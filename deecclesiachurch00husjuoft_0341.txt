 

SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT 287

Hence I always wish to know the ground or reason of the
general interdict by which the righteous without demerit of
their own are deprived of the sacraments, such as communion,
confession, and others, and at times infants are deprived of
baptism; similarly why it is that the divine ministries of
God are reduced in the case of righteous men by an inter-
dict issued on account of one single individual.l Exceed-
ingly wonderful would it be if service was withdrawn from
an earthly king by all good servants on account of one of
the servants who was opposed to him. And especially won-
derful would this be if, on account of one that was a good
and faithful servant of the king, a vassal, wishing to bend
him to his own will, should interdict all the king's servants
to do ministry to the king himself. How, therefore, does a
pope or bishop so inadvisedly, without support of Scripture
or revelation, interdict with such extraordinary ease ministry
to the king, Christ? For when a general interdict is laid
upon a city or diocese, sin does not decrease but rather in-
creases. For to the righteous, sepulture is denied contrary
to Scripture: “Thou shalt not withhold favor from the
dead‚'' Ecclesiasticus 7 ε 33. For who doubts but that to bury
the righteous dead is a work of mercy, for the angel Raphael
addressed Tobias thus: “When thou didst pray with tears and
bury thy dead and didst leave thy repast and hiddest the
dead in thy house, and didst bury them in the night-I car-
ried thy prayer to the Lord‚'' Tobias 12 : 12, 13. Who even
doubts that to hear confession and consult unto salvation
and to preach the Word of God are works of mercy? Sim-

¹ In consequence of the interdict pronounced over Prague by John XXIII,
1411, Huss withdrew at the advice of King Wenzel from the city and remained
in semi-voluntary exile for two years, until he started for Constance October,
1414. He was in doubt whether he had done right in withdrawing, denying
that he had “fied from the truth” and instancing the case of Christ, “who
escaped out of the hands'’ of his enemiffl. He insisted that he was actuated
by a purpose not to prevent the ministrations of the Gospel to the innocent
by his presence in Prague. See Schaff, Life of John Huss, and Huss’s let-
ters written during his exile, Doc., 34—66.
