of the Holy Spirit is required, which cannot be secured ex-
cept from God,'' as Augustine proves in many places, as Ι
have shown in my Tract on Indulgences. And the Master
of Sentences, 1 : 14 [Migne's ed.‚ p. 49]‚ concludes from these
words of Augustine and says, “Therefore no men, however
holy‚ can give the Holy Spirit,'' and the same reasoning
applies to the active remission of sins.1

Hence in a unique sense the Baptist said of Christ: “Be-
hold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world,''
John 1 : 29. On these words Augustine says, Hom. on John,
4 [N ic. F athen, 7 z 28]: “Let no one presume and say of him-
self that he takes away the sins of the world. Now, observe
the proud against whom John lifted his finger were not yet
heretics and yet they were already shown to be such against
whom he cried from the river.” Wherefore the Jews often
ascribed blasphemy to Christ because, esteeming him, though
falsely, to be a mere man, they said he was not able of him-
self to forgive sins, because sin is not forgiven by a mere
word except only as the offense against God is relaxed. But
who forgives an injury except the person against whom it is
done or against whose subject it is done? For God, in giv-

self before His vicar can forgive. Hence on this point Am-
brose says: “He alone forgives sins who alone died for us.
The Word of God forgives sins. The priest is the judge.
The priest performs his function and does not exercise the

¹The Trealz'ses on Papal Indulgences, M on„ 1 : 215-237, was called forth
by John XXIII's two bulls, calling for a crusade against Ladislaus, king of
Naples, 1412, and promising liberal indulgence for participation in the cam—
paign. The bulls created a great sensation in Prague, where the billets of par-
don were openly sold at three different places. Huss attacked the whole system
of wars against fellow Christians started at the pope’s instance, and entered
into the question of papal and priestly absolution. He declared that if the
pope had the right to give indulgences, he was a criminal if he did not empty
purgatory. He took up the same position as here that the priest cannot ab·
solve whom God has not before absolved, and that the priest‘s power is essen-
tially the same as the priest’s power under the O. T. in pronouncing a leper
clean. Sec Huss, Super IV. Seni„ 606 sqq„ and Introd. to this volume.
