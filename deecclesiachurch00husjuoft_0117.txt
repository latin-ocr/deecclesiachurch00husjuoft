ROMAN PONTIF F AND CARDINALS 63

dience of the Roman bishop, just as the Antiochian church
was called the company of Christ's faithful, under the bishop
of Antioch. The same also was true of the faithful in Alex-
andria and Constantinople. And in this way Peter, Christ's
apostle and Roman bishop‚ speaks of the church when, ad-
dressing the faithful in Christ in Pontus, Galatia, Cappa-
docia, Asia, and Bithynia, he says: “The church which is
gathered together¹ in Babylon saluteth you‚’' I Peter 5 : 13.
Is not the church here taken to mean the faithful of Christ
who were at Rome with St. Peter? After the same manner
also, the apostle designated particular churches when he
wrote from Corinth to the Romans, “all the churches of Christ
salute you,'' and a little further on: “I, Tertius, salute you,
who wrote the epistle in the Lord. Gaius my host and the
whole church saluteth you.'' Romans 16 : 16, 23. Here the
whole church is taken for all Christ's faithful, who with Paul
were waging warfare in Corinth. Likewise we have the
words: “To the church of God which is in Corinth, sancti-
fied in Christ Jesus,'' I Cor. 1 : 2, and “Paul and Sylvanus
and Timotheus to the church of the Thessalonjans,'' Ι Thess.
1 : 2. We have the same often in other places, so that those
are properly called particular churches which separately are
parts of the universal church, which is the church of Jesus
Christ.

But the Christian church had its beginning in Judea and
was first called the church of Jerusalem, as it is said: “In
that day there arose a great persecution in the church which
was in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the
regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles,’' Acts
8 : 1. The second church was the Antiochian, in which Peter,
the apostle‚ resided, and there, for the first time, the name
Christian was employed. Hence, the faithful were first
called disciples and brethren, and later Chrisffians, for we
read: “The apostles and brethren which were in Judea‚''
