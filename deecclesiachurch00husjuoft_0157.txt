 

POWER OF BINDING AND LOOSING 103

for Peter himself, Christ’s first vicar, sinned in these regards.

Likewise, God is the only being who cannot be ignorant
as to whose sins may be remitted, and He the only being who
cannot be moved by a wrong motive and judge unjust judg-
ment. But any vicar may be ignorant as to whose sins ought
to be remitted, and he may be moved by a wrong motive in
binding or loosing. Therefore, is he refuse to impart absolu-
tion to one truly penitent and confessing, moved by anger or
greed, he cannot by his act bind such a person in guilt. Sim-
ilar would be the case with one who came with a lying con-
fession, as happens very often, and the priest, not knowing
his hypocrisy, should impart to him the words of absolution.
Undoubtedly he does not thereby absolve, for the Scriptures
say, Wisdom [of Solomon] 1 : 4: “The Holy Spirit evades
a seigned act of worship.” In the first case, just noted, the
vicar alleges that he bound or forgave sins and did not3 and
in the second case he alleges that he loosed or remitted sins and
did not. And it is evident how great the illusion may be of
those who administer the keys and of those who do not truly
repent. For it is necessary that a person, wishing to be ab-
solved, be first so disposed in his will that he is sorry for his
guilt, and then have the purpose to sin no more. Hence,
all priests combined—who are at the same time vicars—are
not able to absolve from sins him who wishes to go on sin-
ning and who does not wish to lament his sins.

So all together are not able to bind a righteous man or
retain his sins when he humbles himself with his whole heart
and has a contrite heart, a thing which God does not despise.
Wherefore St. jerome, commenting on Matt. 16 : 19 [Migne's
ed., 26 ε 118], “I will give unto thee the keys of the king-
dom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt Ioose on earth
shall be loosed in heaven,'' etc., says: “Some not under—
