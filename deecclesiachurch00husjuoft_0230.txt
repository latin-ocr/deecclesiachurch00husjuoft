176 THE CHURCH

For he himself may lawfully say: “Thus I will, thus I com-
mand3 let my will be the reason.'' And so he is impeccable;
and he cannot commit simony because all things are his.
Therefore, he may do with his as he pleases, for he is able
even to command angels and to save men or damn them as
he chooses, and, what is more, he is able to bend not only
the pope but the subject people and those who will not
bow themselves in fiattery and in a worldly way before
him as the head and the honorable one and bend their
knees to him. For the pope, the people and themselves
also they lead astray into wrong paths by sowing such lies.
And it is about them, as is probable, that Christ spoke the
words: “There shall arise pseudo-Christs and pseudo-prophets
and shall show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray
if possible even the elect,” Matt. 24 : 24.

that “it was, presumably, of his good works that he spoke in
addressing that pope’' [Damasus]. But whether St. Jerome
had a revelation with regard to this pope’s predestination
and the righteousness of his works is unknown. In the second
place, it is said that St. Jerome addressed the pope in this

and in the symbols of the church, as appears to one who
wishes to read the letter. And hence he says: “This is the
saith which we have learned in the catholic church, and which
we have always held.'’ It is clear how the conditional clement
in St. Jerome's statement is to be understood. For, if that
confession of his was confirmed by the judgment of that pope,
whosoever might impugn it would be a heretic. For presum-
ably he said and affirmed nothing by revelation or certitude
of the saith he was setting forth which the pope would not con-
firm except it were true, and he would not change anything
rightly held in the church long before. But it would be in-
sane to believe that a conclusion is to be drawn from this con-
cerning every Roman pope, for it is certain that many of them
