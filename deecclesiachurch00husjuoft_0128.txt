74 THE CHURCH

laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the
stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: for
it was founded on the rock,'' Luke 6 z 47. And what this foun-
dation is, the apostle Paul shows in Ι Cor. 3 : 11: “Other
foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is
Christ Jesus”; and I Cor. 10 : 4: “But the rock was Christ.’'
Therefore, it is in this foundation and on this rock and from
this rock up that the holy church is built, for he says: “Upon
this Rock Ι will build my church.''

And on this foundation the apostles built the church of
Christ. For not to themselves did they call the people, but
to Christ, who is the first, the essential and most effectual
foundation. For this reason the apostle said: “Other founda-

is Apollos and what is Paul? His ministers whom ye believed
and each one as the Lord gave to him'' to minister to the
church, I Cor. 3 : 5. He said: “I planted,’' that is by preach-

the increase,'' that is through the founding by faith‚ hope, and
love. Therefore, “neither he that planteth,’' as Paul, “is
anything, nor he that watereth‚'' like Apollos‚ “is anything,’'
that is anything upon which the church may be founded, but
only God who giveth the increase; He is the church’s founda-
tion. And the words follow: “Let every one take heed how
he buildeth thereon, for other foundation can no man lay
than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus.''

Now, this foundation is the rock of righteousness of which
