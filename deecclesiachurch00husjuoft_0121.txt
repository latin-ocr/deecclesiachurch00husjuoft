CHAPTER VIII

THE FAITH WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE
CHURCH

So far as the second thing is concerned [involved in Matt.
16 : 16-18], that is, saith, which is touched upon in the words,
“Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God''—it is to be
noted that saith is now taken for the act of believing by which
we believe, now for the inward state or disposition—habitu&—
οἱ believing through which we believe, and now for the truth
which we believe, as Augustine lays down, de T rinitate, 13
[Nic. FatherS, 3 : 166 sqq.].

In the second place, it is to be noted that there is one saith
which is the explicit belief of a faithful man and that there is
another saith which is implicit saith as the catholic, who has
the disposition—habitus—of saith infused or explicitly ac-
quired, believes in the catholic church in common with others
and by reason of that common faith believes implicitly what-
ever single thing is included under holy mother church.2 Like-
wise in believing whatsoever Christ wished to be believed

¹ In his Super IV. Seni„ 452, Huss defines the meaning of the word when he
says “fides est habitus vel virtus—provided saith is formed in love.''

² The distinction between implicit and explicit saith, which starts with Augus-
tine, is the distinction between acceptance of doctrines on the ground of obedi-
ence to the church and a real assent to them as doctrines. So Thomas Aquinas,
who says, in essenee, that implicit saith is acceptance oi things to be believed as
things contained in the Scriptures, and explicit saith is their acceptance with
the understanding and heart. Summa, 2 : 2, q. 2, 5. Innocent IV, in his
Com. on the Decretals, said that it is enough for laymen to believe in God as
the God of justice and in all other matters, dogmas, and morals-implicite—that
is, to think and say, I believe what the church believes. Innocent went on to

say that clerics were under obligation to follow the commands of a pope that
were unrighteous. Dollinger‚ Akad. Vort„ 2 : 49.
