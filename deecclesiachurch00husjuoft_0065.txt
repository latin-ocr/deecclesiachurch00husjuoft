CHAPTER II

THE ONE UNIVERSAL CHURCH DIVIDED INTO
THREE PARTS

IT having been said what the holy universal church is—
that she is only one just as the number of all the predestinate
is one, and also that she is distributed in her members through-
out all the word—it must be known that this holy universal
church is tripartite, that is, divided into the church trium-
phant, militant and dormient.

The church militant is the number of the predestinate
now on its pilgrimage to the heavenly country, and is called
militant because it wages Christ’s warfare against the flesh,
the world and the devil.

The church dormient is the number of the predestinate
suffering in purgatory. It is called dormient because being
there she does not enJ‘oy the blessedness which in the present
life through God's prevenient and assisting grace she merited
that she might get her reward in the heavenly country after
the satisfaction made in purgatory.

The church triumphant consists of the blessed at rest in
the heavenly country who kept up Christ’s warfare against
Satan and have finally triumphed. There will, however, be
one great church on the day of judgment, made up of all
these. And as a symbol of these three parts the doctors say

13 : 26. The custom is for the priest to break the host into two equal parts.
He then drops a fragment of one of these parts into the chalice, whose contents
