2 18 THE CHURCH

midst of Paradise. In these things, certainly, it is not right
to prefer our thoughts to the sentence of the teachers. In
these things neither the command of prelates nor their pro-
hibition is to be in all cases spurned.'' And further on, Ber-
nard says: “Faith‚ hope and love are absolutely good, and
other things of this kind; and they may not be either for-
bidden or not kept. Absolutely evil are sacrilege, adultery,
theft, and such like, which certainly may neither be properly
enjoined nor done, and they may not be improperly not ¹
forbidden and not done. For no one’s prohibition is valid
to set aside precepts‚ and no one's commandments are valid
to prejudice in favor of things forbidden.

“Then there are the things intermediate, which indeed of
themselves are not known to be either good or evil. They
may, however, indifferently be either good or bad; they
may be commanded or forbidden, but under no circum-
stances are they to be obeyed by inferiors, when they are
evil. Among these are, by way of example, tasting, vigils,
reading and such like. But it should be known that cer-
tain things intermediate go beyond the reason of things
impure or evil. For since marriage may occur or not occur,
but when once entered into it is not permissible to undo it,
what, therefore, before marriage was permitted to be, as a
thing indifferent, obtains in those already married the force
of the absolutely good. Likewise, it is a matter indifferent
for a secular man to possess private property, because he
has the option of not possessing. But for a monk, because
he is not permitted to have possessions‚ to possess goods is
an absolute evil.'' Thus much Bernard.

Also it is to be noted that, so far as the sense of those
speaking about human actions goes, a certain work is called
neutral among them which, in its primary intent, cannot be
said to be a good of morals or an evil of vice, as, for example,
to build or to weave. But works are called good or evil

¹ Huss has improperly inserted this “not’' which is not found in Migne.
