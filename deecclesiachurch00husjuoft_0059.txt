THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH 5

strong woman whose maidens are clothed with double gar-
ments, Prov. 21 : 2. She is the queen, of whom the Psalmist
says: “The queen stands at thy right hand in vestments of
gold '' [Psalms 45 : 9]. This is Jerusalem, our mother, the tem-
ple of the Lord, the kingdom of heaven and the city of the
Great King; and this whole church, as Augustine, Enchiridz’on,
41 [Nic. Fathers, 3 : 255, 256], says, “is to be understood not
only of that part which sojourns here, praising God from the
rising to the setting of the sun, and which, after its old cap-
tivity, is singing the new song, but also of that part in heaven
which, continuing true to the purpose for which it was con-
stituted, has always been loyal to God, and has never felt
misery from any fall. This part among the holy angels re-
mains blessed and, as it behooves it to d0, helps the part so-
journing upon the earth, because she who is to be one by the
companionship of eternity is now also one by the bond of
love. And this whole church was constituted to worship
God. Therefore, neither the whole nor any part of it wishes
to be worshipped as God.” So far, Augustine.

This is the holy catholic church which Christians profess
immediately after professing their saith in the Holy Spirit.¹
F irst, because, as Augustine says,2 she is the highest creature,

bride‚’' Cant. 4 : 12. Alanus ab Insulis speaks of the Canticles as referring
to the church, but in the highest spiritual sense to Mary, and another of the
saner Schoolmen‚ Rupert of Deutz, fills his commentary on the Canticles with
the most tropical language.

¹The reference is to the Apostles' Creed, “I believe in the holy catholic
church,’' which is preceded by the confession of God the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost‚ Also the Nicene creed. See Schaff, Creeds, 2 ε 57 sq. With
regard to the intercession of the saints in heaven and on earth, the council of
Trent, XXV, says: “That the saints who reign together with Christ offer up
their own prayers to God for men, and it is good and useful suppliantly to in-
voke them, and to have recourse to their prayers and help for obtaining bene-
fits from God through his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, who is our only Redeemer
and Saviour.’'

² In the Enchiriziion, as quoted above. Augustine makes a similar statement
in his sermon to catechumens, Nic. Fathers, 3 : 375.
