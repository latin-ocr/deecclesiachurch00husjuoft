206 THE CHURCH

and preach the Gospel to every creature,'' Mark 16 : 15. And
these, going forth, preached everywhere, that is, in every
place where the people were willing to listen, God working
with them. Therefore, this command is to the hurt of the
church‚ and binds the Word of God‚ that it should not run
freely. And, in the third place, it is prejudicial to the chapels
which are erected and have with reason been confirmed by
diocesans, and have been furnished with privileges by the
apostolic see for the preaching of God’s Word in them. For
no advantage whatever can be seen to accrue from that
command, but it is a fallacious and faithless irony, be-
cause the places set apart for divine worship and furnished
with privileges for the preaching of the divine Word are de-
prived of their lawful liberties on account of some personal
feeling or of some injurious appeal or some importunity‚ or
on account of some temporal good. Hence, I appealed from
that command of Alexander to Alexander himself, better in-
formed.l And while Ι was prosecuting the appeal, that lord
pope suddenly died. And, no audience being allowed me in
the Roman curia, the Lord Zbynek, archbishop of Prague
secured papers aggravating the censure against me, from
which, A. D. 1410, I appealed to Pope John XXIII, and he
during two years did not grant audience to my legal advo-
cates and solicitors.² In the meantime I was weighed down
still more by ecclesiastical proceedings.³ When, therefore,
my appeal from one pope to his successor did not profit me
and to appeal from the pope to a council involves long wait-
ing and because it is of uncertain advantage to beg for grace
in the matter of a grievance and censure, therefore I appealed

¹ Huss claimed that Alexander had been misinformed by Zbynek and the
Prague clergy in regard to the conditions in Prague.

² John of Jesenicz, Huss’s chief legal advocate, remained faithful till Huss’s
death, and after it. He presented Huss's case at Rome and Bologna‚ was cast
into prison and afterwards escaped and returned to Prague. See Schaff, Life
of John Huss, 140 sq.

⁸ The reference is to the aggravated excommunication issued by the curia
against Huss, 1412, in view of his contumacy.
