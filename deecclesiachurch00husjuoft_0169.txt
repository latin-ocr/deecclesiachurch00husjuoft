THE ABUSE OF SCRIPTURE 115

exercise who allege that they can either damn the deserving
or loose those who are bound, and they do this because the
obedience they falsely demand is refused them or for the
sake of the gain they derive. Of such priests the Lord said:
“They polluted me among my people for a handful of barley
and a piece of bread that they might slay souls, which do
not die, and make alive souls‚ which do not live, lying to
my people which believes lies,'' Ezek. 13 ε 19. On this
passage Gregory comments, 11 ε 3, Plerisquel [Friedberg,
1 : 667]‚ and says: “Rightly does the prophet say they put
souls to death which do not die and make alive souls which
do not live. For, indeed, he puts to death one who does
not die when he condemns the righteous, and he attempts to
make alive him who does not live² when he seeks to loose
the guilty from the sentence of death.'' This abuse of power
they exercise who sell and buy the sacred orders, episcopates,
canonries, and parishes—plebanias. They secure and sell
simoniacally who make spoil out of the sacraments, living in
pleasure‚ avarice, and luxury or who, by any other kind of
criminality, defile the power of the priesthood. For even if
they declare that they know God, they, nevertbeles5‚ deny ³
Him by their deeds, Titus 1 ε 16. Consequently, they do
not believe in God, and so, as unbelieving children, they
have unbelieving thoughts about the seven sacraments of the
church and also about the keys, the ministries, censures, the
customs, ceremonies, and sacred things of the church and
likewise the worship of relies, indulgences, and sacred orders.

This is clear because such despise God's name. Hence it
is said in Mal. 1 : 6, 10: “Unto you, O priests, that despise
my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name ?
Ye offer polluted bread upon my altar. . . . Oh, that there
were one among you that would shut the doors and kindle

sumed to say, saying fifteen a day, they would not have gotten through in fif-

teen years. One of Gregory VII's reform mox-ements was to do away with

clerical simony. Dante put simoniacal popes in hell, including Boniface VIII.
