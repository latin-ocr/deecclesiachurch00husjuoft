 

HUSS'S RESISTANCE TO THE POPE 185

that it is of no advantage to obey any one except in so far
as such obedience is obedience to our God.

Wherefore, as to that saying of the doctors, “that obe·
dience is due to the apostolic see of the Roman church and
to prelates by inferiors in all things,'’ etc. [we proceed as fol-
lows]:

As for obedience, this is to be said: It is to be noted that
obedience first is to be understood by analogy or in a very
general sense, as is the loyalty of any created thing whatso-
ever, in respect to the divine will which all created things
obey, without resistance—repugnantia—even as a stone obeys
by falling or tending downwards‚ or fire by rising and the sun
by illuminating, and so in regard to all other created things.
Or else obedience is rendered with resistance, as the devil or
a damned man who obeys by suffering because he must. And
in this way the saints speak when they say that all things
obey their Creator, and man alone, the sinner‚ does not obey;
that is, the sinner does not submit to the rule of the Creator
without resistance on the part of his will. But obedience,
so far as it is an act oi virtue or is virtue, is thus de-
scribed by some, namely, obedience is the subjection of our
own will to the will and judgment of a superior in things
lawful and honest—or obedience is the disposition to fol-
low voluntarily a superior’s command in things lawful and
honest.

The first kind is exhibited in acts, the second in the dis-
position. And from these definitions, it follows that there is no
such thing as obedience in the case of things unlawful. And
so obedience is correlated to that which is good, disobedience
to that which is evil. But the first definition seems to
me to be wanting in this, that obedience is a more gen-
eral thing than submission‚ since obedience is becoming in
God and submission is not, for God obeyed a man's voice,
for it is said, Joshua 10 : 14: “There was no day like to it
before or after, that God hearkened unto the voice of a man
