hirelings but the voice of the Shepherd at the callos the hire-
ling. Listen to the hirelings as they are set forth by the
Lord himself. ‘Scribes,' he said, ‘ and Pharisees sit in Moses'
seat. Whatsoever they bid you, those things do, but what-
soever they do, do not ye.’ What else did he say except
hear the voice of the shepherd when the hireling calls? For,
sitting in Moses' seat, they teach God’s law; therefore God
teaches through them. But, if they seek to teach their own
things, hear them not, do them not, for certainly such people
seek their own things and not the things of Jesus Christ.
No hireling, however, has dared to say to the people of God:
‘I seek thy things and not the things of Jesus Christ.’ '’ Thus
much Augustine. At the close of this homily he uses these
words: “ See, how the hireling is said to flee when he seeth

those least ones are reprobates, who teach in words, speak-
ing good things, which they break by living ill, and that
they will not be as the least in the life eternal and will not
even be there, after Christ had said, ‘he shall be called least
in the kingdom of heaven,' Christ added: ‘for 1 say unto you
except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of
the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter the kingdom of
heaven.' These certainly are the scribes and Pharisees who
sit in Moses' seat, and of these Christ said: ‘Whatsoever they
bid you, do, but whatsoever they do, do not ye, for they
