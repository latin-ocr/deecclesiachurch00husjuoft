62 THE CHURCH

unmoved and unmovable for all time.'' Here no pope with
his college of cardinals can be understood. For often these
are as soiled with wicked, deceitful depravity and sin, as at
the time of pope Joanna‚ the Englishwoman, who was called
Agnes. How, therefore, did that Roman church—that Agnes,
pope Joanna with college—remain always unspotted, seeing

But it is to be noted that the Roman church was properly
called a company of Christ's faithful, living under the obe-
