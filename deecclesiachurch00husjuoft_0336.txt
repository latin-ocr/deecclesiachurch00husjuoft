282 THE CHURCH

untary tithes‚ because a benefice is not given except for the
performance of duty. And inasmuch as the same sentence
or a greater one holds for spiritual fornication, which is a
greater offence, it is evident that the inferior ought to be
suspended by the superior prelate‚ namely, for the spiritual
sin—which is more graVffiwhatever it may be. And as it
is certain that Luciferian pride in a prelate, neglect of evan-
gelizing and avarice like that of Iscariot are sins more grave
than carnal fornication‚ it is plain that the supreme prelate‚
Christ Jesus, to whom these graver sins are chiefly known,
does not withhold suspension on any excuse proportioned
to the guilt. From these things, when the condition of the
church is inquired into, it is gathered that from pope down
to the lowest priest rarely is one exempt for a given time from
suspension unless it be he who blamelessly follows the Lord
Jesus Christ. For it has already been said how fornicators
are suspended. Likewise of simoniae clerics‚ Quicumque by
Gregory, and Reper. by Ambrose [1: 1 :cap. 2, 7 ; Fried-
berg, 1 : 358, 3 59]. Likewise clerics are suspended for brood-
ing overl base gains and lucre‚'' Dist. 88 [F riedberg, 1 : 307].
And since all these persons, in view of the law of Christ, min-
ister to the church unworthily, it is clear how manifold are
the irregularities and profanations which the clergy of the
church are involved in.

Of profanation I have treated in the tract contra adver-
sarium occultum,² showing how every wicked presbyter pro-
fanes—that is, violates‚ curses‚ and contaminates—God's spir-
itual temple. For, to follow the saints in their lives is un-

ing.
² “Against the Hidden Adversary‚” M on„ 1 z 168-179. This treatise, writ-
ten 1412 in reply to an attack that Huss was destroying the law and also de-
stroying the priesthood by his preaching‚ brings out: (1) That the wickednaes
of the pcople and the priests brought about the destruction of Jerusalem, and
(2) that by driving out the hucksters from the temple and by many in-
stances in the O. T. it was taught that secular princes have the duty of pun-
ishing simoniae priests by withdrawing from them their livings.
