36 THE CHURCH

from which they cannot fall away, and so the predestinate‚
being now righteous and having twofold grace, are bound by
a twofold bond.

But here the objection is made that, in view of the things
said above, we ought to grant that at one and the same
time the same person may be righteous and unrighteous,
one of the faithful and an unbeliever, a true Christian and a
heretic, in abounding grace and without gracel (not to use
other such contradictory expressions), it follows that there
is a manifest contradiction. In this objection it is said that
it should be granted that the same person is at one and the
same time both righteous and unrighteous; but it is in-
consistent with the truth, that the same person is at one and
the same time both righteous and unrighteous in respect to the
same thing. Even as contraries cannot at one and the same
time inhere in the same person in respect to the same thing,
so the names given above are, on account of their ambiguity,
not contrary one to the other, for, according to the Philoso-
pher2 only one thing can be opposed to one thing, and so the
same man is righteous by virtue of predestinating grace and
unrighteous by virtue of destructive vice, as was Peter in his
denial of Christ and Paul in his persecution of him. For they
were at that time not fallen away from the love of predesti-
nation. Consequently they were, in view of this love, in grace
and therefore righteous; and because they were at that time
in sin they were deprived of fluent temporal grace and there-
fore were unrighteous. And if the inference be drawn: there-
fore they were at that time not righteous and consequently
were not righteous at all, the inference is drawn by denying
the first consequence. For a consequence which is drawn by
proceeding from a denial to a negation does not hold except
with modification as follows in this proposition, namely:

¹Here, as a little further down, Huss uses the Greek acharis.
²Aristotle, whom the Schoolmen regarded as the forerunner of Christian
{ruth in method and knowledge os natural things—precursor Christi in naturali-
us.
