and fought for Israel.'' Nevertheless God, the Trinity, was
not subject to man, or under a man as 3 lesser to a greater.
Nor is all obedience to the will of a superior, for Christ was
subject to his parents, Luke 2 : 51. And it is certain that,
as among others born of women a greater than John the
Baptist hath not arisen‚ so Christ was infinitely greater than
Joseph or Mary.

Therefore‚ as Christ did nothing but what he ought to
have done, it is plain that the greater ought to be subject
to the lesser, that is, be obedient to him; for whatever the
fountain of religion, as the chief of all, may teach, that is
to be held. Hence Christ, who was of a twofold nature,
was obedient in a twofold sense, for (1) he obeyed God, his
F ather, in all things, as being on the side of his humanity
less than the Father, for he himself said: “The Father is
greater than I,'’ John 14 : 28. And (2) he was obedient to his
parents as to the lesser. And he was also obedient to others
and endured willingly at their hands, and he is obedient to
true and holy Christians‚ supplying their need and filling up
their desires. And it is clear that the conclusion does not
follow: because one obeys another, therefore he is less than
the other. Similarly, it does not follow that, because one
serves another, therefore he is less than the other. For
Christ obeyed another man and served him, wherefore he
said, Isaiah 43 z 24: “Thou hast made me to serve in thy
sins, thou hast put upon me toil in thy iniquities. I am he
that blotteth out thy iniquities for my own sake, and I will
not remember thy sins. Put me in remembrance that we
may be judged together.’' He also said: “The Son of Man
came not to be ministered unto but to minister‚'’ Matt. 20 ε 28.
And the apostle was speaking of him when he said: “Christ
emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,’' Phil. 2 : 7.
And it is also said, John 13 : 4: “He girded himself with a
towel‚ poured water in a basin and washed his disciples' feet.''
Hence he is not falsely but truly a bishop, a servant of the
