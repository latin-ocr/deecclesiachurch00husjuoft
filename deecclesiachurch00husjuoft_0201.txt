CHAPTER XV

THE CHURCH MAY BE RULED WITHOUT POPE
AND CARDINALS

Tm: fifth point is this: “ for the government of the church
throughout the whole world, there ought always to be car-
dinals as the manifest and true successors in the office of
Peter, the prince of the apostles‚ and of Christ’s other apos-
tles.” Here that word “ought'’ does not mean opportuneness
——opportunitas—on the side of God who rules the church,
and who is able to rule the church scattered throughout the
world, without such successors‚ nor does it mean fitness on
the side of the church which can be properly ruled by holy
priests, even if those twelve cardinals were removed; just
as it was ruled for three hundred years and more after Christ's
ascension, unless perhaps it be said that that word “ought''
means necessity, a thing which the Saviour indicated when he
said: “It must needs be that offences come, but woe to that
man by whom the offence cometh‚'’ Matt. 18 : 7. For these
words the Saviour spoke after his rebuke of his disciples who
asked who was the greatest among them, when he commanded
them, saying: “Verily I say unto you, except ye turn and
become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the
kingdom of heaven,'’ Matt. 18 ε 3. And, that they might
not offend by pride those who believed in Christ, he added:
“Whoso shall cause one os these little ones that believe on
me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone
should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk
in the depth of the sea,'' Matt. 18 ε 6.

Commenting on these words, St. Gregory, Pastoral Rule
1 : 2 [Nic. Famem, 2d Ser„ 12 : 2]‚ says: “Pastors, perverse

in their lives, impugn in their morals what they preach in
