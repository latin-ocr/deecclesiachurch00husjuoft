100 THE CHURCH

want to wholly abandon their sins. Many promise cantion
for the future but do not want to make satisfaction. All of
this sort, in so far as they do not truly repent, beyond doubt
ought not to be forgiven. For truly to repent is to be sorry
for past wrong-doing, to confess with a strong purpose, to
make satisfaction, and to take heed to oneself with all cau-
tion. Those who do penance in this way, they ought to be
forgiven3 and to be remitted in any other way without ab-
solution‚ this is to retain sins. Now, from the things already
said we may clearly understand that, in the forgiveness of
sins, the Lord does by and of Himself what is done through
his minister, that is, he does not by Himself and through the
office of ministers‚ but He fully of Himself looses the bond
of obduracy; and He looses by Himself and His minister
the debt of eternal damnation3 truly He looses by his min-
isters the debt of future purgation. The power of the first
kind of forgiveness He reserves for Himself alone. The
second kind of forgiveness He imparts by Himself and His
minister. But the third kind, the Lord is accustomed to
impart not as much by Himself as by his minister. Properly,
indeed, is it said that the Lord absolves the truly penitent
from the bond of damnation. None the less it is true that
the priest does this and the Lord,¹ the Lord in view of
the conversion of the heart, and the priest in view of the
confession of the mouth. For the confession of the heart
alone suffices in the case of the truly penitent unto salva-
tion. And the case—articulus—of necessity excludes both
the confession of the mouth and absolution by the priest.'’

- Thus much Richard.

From these things the conclusion is drawn that God pre-
destinates from eternity‚ and He executes in time the abso-
lution of a person who is to be saved and the remission of
his sin, before such a person is absolved on earth by the min-

¹The expression, “and the Lord” is not in Richard’s text. Otherwise
Huss’s quotation is exact.
