IN TRODUCTION xxxvii

The first is that Huss, as also Wyclif before him, con-
tinued to call the church mother and holy mother. Although
this designation has the prestige of high antiquity‚ it is to
be used with great caution. The church is not a personality,
giving birth to spiritual children. The designation is drawn
from Paul's placing Christ and the church figuratively in
the relation of bridegroom and bride. But nowhere in the
New Testament is the church called mother or bringing forth
ascribed to it. The term is bound up with the conception of
the church as a saving institution and its use developed with
the development of the sacramental system. From the
Protestant standpoint it is fallacious. Wyclif and Huss,
again and again, pronounce it a metaphor and so prepared
the way for its rejection by the Reformers.1

Another remark is that Huss makes not a little of church
history. He had the historical sense and less of the scho-
lastic than we might expect. The age of criticism was dawn-
ing not only among the men of the Renaissance but in the
church. It is interesting to compare Luther⁷s conception
of the use of history to do away with bad usages. In
his Introduction to Dr. Bames‘s History os the Lives os tlte
Popes, issued in 1536, he said that, in the beginning, not
being much versed in the lives of the popes, he attacked the
papacy a priori, that is, from holy Scripture, but was won-
derfully delighted that others were doing the same a poste-
riori, that is, from history.2 Huss used history to prove the
truth of Scripture.

A third remark is that nowhere in this treatise does Huss
use the passage, John 17, “that they may be one as thou,

¹In his Super IV. sent„ p. 469, Huss speaks of the church as our most
dear mother, the most worthy mother of predestination, etc. In his Com.
on the Decalogue, Flajshans's ed., p. 19, he says of the fifth commandment:
By some “thy spiritual father'’ is said to be the prioet and truly ‘⁴ thy mother’'
is the church. He then went on to speak of another interpretation by which
the Christian has three mothers, a mother after the flaeh, a spiritual mother,
the church, and a celoetial mother, Mary. Cyprian presented the mediaeval
view when he said: “He cannot have God for his father who does not have
the church for his mother.” Schaff, Ch. Hisae., II, 173.
