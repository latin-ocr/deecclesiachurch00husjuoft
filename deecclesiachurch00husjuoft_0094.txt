40 THE CHURCH

and grace, as the reprobate righteous, who are not in the
church by virtue of predestination to life eternal. Others
are in the church by virtue of predestination only, as are un-
baptized children oi Christian parents and pagans, or Jews
destined to be Christians in the future. Others are in the
church by virtue of an unformed saith and predestination,
as are predestinate Christians who are now in sins, but will
return to grace. Others are in the church by virtue of pre-
destination and present grace, as are all predestinate Christians
who imitate Christ in their lives, who, however, may in this
life fall away from fiuent [operating] grace. Still others are
in the church now triumphant, confirmed in grace. But all
are divided into the reprobate and the predestinate, the former
being ultimately the members of the devil and the others
members of the mystical body which is the holy church, the
bride of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Therefore, in the first proof taken from the net, the pre-
destinate are represented by the good fish, and the reprobate
by the bad fish which they cast out. On this Gregory [Migne‚
76 : 1116] has this to say: “Holy church is compared to a
net cast into the sea, for she also is committed to fishermen.
This is the first resemblance, and by her every one is drawn
from the waves of this present age into the eternal kingdom,
namely by call, lest he be drowned in the depths of eternal
death. This is the second resemblance. She gathers together
fish of every kind, because she calls to the forgiveness of sins
the wise and the foolish‚ the free and the bond, the poor and
the rich, the strong and the weak. This is the third re-
semblance.'’

Therefore, let the false writer be on his guard against
inferring that, because holy church gathers together by her
call men of every kind, therefore all men are called to faith
which is in Christ and are members of holy church, Christ's
bride. Hence St. Gregory conclusively shows who are the
elect and who are the reprobate, when he says that “at the end
