OBEDIENCE TO PRELATES 251

it be lawful for a subject to obey contrary to the custom
approved in the church and contrary to the conscience of
this subject which resists, or, if he should bid him wander
in the middle of the night through woods among cruel wild
beasts when there was no necessity for it? And many are
the commandments os this kind repugnant to reason. Nor
should an argument be made in favor os obedience‚ if it were
anywhere found in the lives of the Fathers, that subjects in
the case of works which are without fitness or neutral obeyed,
even as certain of the holy Fathers did obey, as Hugo of St.
Victor, Libellum Mandatum, speaking of these things which
may not lawfully be done, said: “Just as we read that cer-
tain of the holy F athers commanded subjects many things
foreign to human reason that they might teach them the vir-
tue of obedience‚ such as watering dry parts until they pro-
duced seeds or sostening hard stones by pouring water over
them and taming ferocious beasts by a word of command.''

So far as the circumstance of the person is concerned, it
is clear that here reason ought to direct as to a work good
generically and also neutral. In a work generically good, if
the prelate should command the subject to give alms by
pauperizing his boys, or to take up penance by fasting which
he is not capable of enduring‚ or to make many prayers even
as confessors lay hard tasks upon men—certainly in such
cases a pope is not to be hearkened to, since a parent is
more bound to nourish his boys than to give alms to others;
and he is not bound to bear insufferable burdens. The same
is true in works neutral, for, if ever a pope should command
me to play on the flute‚ build towers, to mend or weave
garments, and to stuff sausages, ought not my reason to
judge that the pope was foolish in so commanding? Why
should I not prefer in this matter my common sense to the
pope's sentence? Yea, if with all our doctors he should
command me do these things, the reason would judge that
the sentence of these persons was foolish.
