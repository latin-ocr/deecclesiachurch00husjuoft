THE LAW OF GOD 181

(12) A. D. 1087 Desiderius, called also Victor, was made
pope against Clement.¹

(13) A. D. 1091 there were, it is said, two, who were called
Roman pontifis, at discord one with the other and drawing
about the church of God, divided between themselves, Urban.
who first had been bishop of Ostia, and Clement, called Wibert,
who had been bishop of Ravenna.

(14) A. D. 1130, when Innocent was ruling as pope, Peter
Leoni thrust himself in and was called Anacletus‚ and In-
nocent passed over into F rance.2 Hence it is said:

“Peter has Rome, Gregory the whole world.''

(15) A. D. 1189 Pope Albert ruled, against whom Octa-
vian thrust himself in, but he died in schism, and so also
Guido of Crema; but John, who had thrust himself in, was
reconciled.³

And so within a centenary of years from the time of the
dotation of the church a notable contention occurred between
popes; and in our times there was begun the two—headed
schism between Urban VI, who lived at Rome, and Robert
of Geneva, who held his seat in Avignon; and this two—headed
split lasted between their successors until A. D. 1409. In
that year both popes were condemned at the council of
Pisa as heretics, namely Gregory and Benedict, and Alex-
ander, of the Franciscan order, was elected pope.4 And when

Wibert, “the usurper of the holy see,'' was the only one of his enemies that
Gregory refused to forgive on his death-bed. Hem-y was crowned emperor by
Wibert in St. Peter's. Hildebrand died 1085 at Salerno, not at Beneventum.

¹ Victor III, 1087, was the legitimate pope as against Wibert,

² Anacletus II, antipope 1130—1138, the son of a Jew of Rome and elected
by the maj0rity of the cardinals. Innocent ΙΙ, 1130-1143, elected by a minor-
ity had the support of Bernard and the emperor. Anacletus’s last supportet
was Roget of Sicily. See Schaff, Ch. Hist„ V, part 1, 94 sq.

³ Albert was antipope at the time of Pascal ΙΙ; Octavian, Victor IV, under
Alexander ΙΙΙ in the days of Barbarossa, and Guido at Victor's death, 1164,
elected antipope under the name of Pascal ΙΙΙ.

⁴ At the death of Gregory XI, the Avignon pope, in Rome, 1378, Urban VI,
an Italian, was made pope under circumstances the most sensational. See
Schaff, Ch. Hist., V, part 2, 117 sqq. This election was followed by the election
