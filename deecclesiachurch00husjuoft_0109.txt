CHRIST THE HEAD OF THE ELECT 55

forever. But what the church of Christ or the synagogue of
Satan are or will be—-whether in the case of men or—more
numerously—in the case of the angels—we shall fully know
after Christ the Lord has pronounced the final judgment. For
he himself says: “Enter ye in at the strait gate, for wide is
the gate and broad is the way which leadeth unto perdition
and many there are who go in thereat, for strait is the gate
and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there
are who find it.” Matt. 7 z 13. On this passage Chrysostom
says, Homil. 18 [Nic. Fathers 10 : 163]: “The way of Christ
is said to be strait and narrow, because Christ received to
himself only those who divested themselves of all sins, laid
down all the care of this world and were made refined and
spiritual—subtiles et spirituales.’'

Almighty Lord, who art the way, the truth‚ and the life,
Thou knowest how few in this present time walk in Thee,
how few imitate Thee as their head, in humility‚ poverty,
chastity‚ diligence‚ and patience. Open is the way of Satan;
many walk therein. Help Thy weak flock, that it may not
forsake Thee, but follow Thee unto the end in the narrow
way.
