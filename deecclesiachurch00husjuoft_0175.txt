 

CHRIST THE TRUE ROMAN PONTIFF 121

in heaven, of things on the earth, and things in hell [Phil.
2 : 6 sqq.].

To this the conclusion follows, namely: “To be subject
to the Roman pontifi is necessary for salvation for every
human being.'‘ But there is no other such pontiff except
the Lord Jesus Christ himself, our pontiff. This is so because
the humanity of Christ is not subject to any other pontiff
as of necessity to salvation, inasmuch as God hath exalted
him and given him a name which is to be the most worthy
above every other name, that at the name of Jesus every
knee should bow and every power bend in obedience to him
“of things in heaven,'’ that is, the angels; “things on the
earth,'' that is, all men; and “of things in hell,'' that is, the
devils. And it is also so because Christ’s mother was a human
being3 John the Baptist also, Peter the apostle, and other
saints now in heaven, and for none of these was it necessary
for salvation to be subject to any other Roman pontiff besides
Christ, seeing that they are already saved, persons whom no
Roman pontiff can loose or bind. Therefore‚ Pope Clement
extended his authority all too far when in his bull The An-
gels of Paradise, he commanded the angels to lead into the
everlasting joys the soul of one who had died on a journey to
Rome to secure indulgence, and who had been absolved from
purgatory. For this pope wished that at his command the
heavenly angels should bow their knees. And he added,
“We wish that the pain of hell be not inflicted upon that
soul in any degree,'' and so he commanded that the power
or the knees of the spirits in hell should also bow at his
command. Not so djd the apostles presume, for John wished
not to command but to worship at the feet of angels, as he
said, Rev. 22 : 8: “I, John, fell down to worship before the
feet of the angel, and he said to me, see thou do it not, for
Ι am a fellow servant with thee and with thy brethren the
prophets and with them that keep the words of the prophecy
of this book. Worship God.'' See how great is this apostle
