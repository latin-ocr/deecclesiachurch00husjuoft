THE APOSTOLIC SEE 205

mandment. Indeed, apostolic commands are not and can-
not be other than apostolic teachings and teachings of our
Lord Jesus Christ himself, the teacher of the apostles.'’ Thus
far he of Lincoln. Therefore, Christ's faithful disciple ought
to consider how a command emanates from the pope, whether
it is the express command of any apostle or of Christ’s law
or whether it has its foundation in Christ's laW‚ and this
being known to be the case, he ought to obey a command
of this kind reverently and humbly. But, if he truly knows
that a pope's command is at variance with Christ's com-
mand or counsel or tends to any hurt of the church, then he
ought boldly to resist it lest he become a partaker in crime
by consent.

For this reason, trusting in the Lord and in Christ Jesus‚
who mightily and wisely protects the professors of his truth
and rewards them with the prize of never-ending glory, I
withstood the bull of Alexander V, which Lord Zbynek, arch-
bishop of Prague, secured‚ 1409, and in which he commands
that there should be no more preaching or sermons to the
people by any priest whatsoever-—even though he might be
fortified with an apostolic instrument taking precedence of
such a mandate or by any other written instrument L—except
in cathedrals, parochial or cloistral churches or in their cem-
eteries. This mandate, being contrary to the words and
deeds oi Christ and his apostles‚ is not apostolic, for Christ
preached to the people on the sea, in the desert, in the fields
and houses, in synagogues‚ in villages and on the streets, and
taught his disciples‚ saying: “Go ye into all the world

¹ Alexander V's bull, dated Dec. 20, 1409, was in answer to protaess sent
by the part of the Prague clergy hostile to Huss against the spread of Wyclif's
views in Bohemia. Alexander called upon Zbynek to be solicitous to clear his
diocaee of errors and bade him appoint a commission to detect and summon
heretics. Huss’s text in regard to the prohibition of preaching in chapels is
taken word for word from Alexander’s bull. Palacky‚ Doc„ 347 sqq. Bethle-
hem chapel was one of the privileged chapels which had papal sanction for
popular preaching in the Bohemian tongue. Zbynek, at first favorable to Huss,
was archbishop of Prague, 1403-1411. See Schaff, Life os John H uss.
