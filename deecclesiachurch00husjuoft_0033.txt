common. The chief weapon of attack against him was
Wyclif's system as set forth in the XLV Articles, condemned
hy ecclesiastical authority and recently by the eight doctors
to whom he was replying. ¹

The materials, taken from Wyclif, are under Huss’s hand
subjected to altogether new collocations, and in matters of
detail, where we would expect Huss to have drawn from his
predecessor, he does not. For example, he does not repeat
Wyclif’s use of the ark and the seamless coat of Christ as
figures for the unity of the church nor make reference to
Solomon and the temple. Nor does he introduce David at
the side of Peter as an example of one who is predestinate and
yet is lacking for a time in righteousnesS. Huss omits many
of the authors quoted by Wyclif such as Bradwardine, Henry
of Gauda and, as already stated, Bonaventura. There is
evidence, as Schwab long ago suggested, that Huss was well
read in the canon law and used it independently. As for
Augustine, Loserth has expressed the opinion that Huss
knew his copy well. With Luther, at a later time, he felt
profound respect for this father's theologica] learning *and
piety. In this treatise he designates Augustine now the
“holy man” now the “great doctor'' and pronounced him
the foremost of biblical expositorS, the man who was more

profitable to the church than many popes.¹ As for materials ,

from Scripture Huss’s treatise contains much that Wyclif
does not give as also fresh considerations from reason. His
references to Christ, whom he frequently calls “the best of
masters’' will at times be found to be charged with true
eloquence as well as piety.

If it were necessary to point to the custom of his age to
justify Huss's procedure, the cases of John Gerson and
Cardinal d'Ailly might be cited. Gerson, rector of the uni—
versity of PariS, without making acknowledgment, appro-
priated a considerable part of one of Henry of Langenstein's
