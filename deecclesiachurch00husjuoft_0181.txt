 

THE POPE NOT THE CHURCH’S HEAD 127

it is plain in the case of Agnes, who was called John Angli-
cus‚¹ and of her Castrensis, 5 ε 3,² writes: “A certain woman
sat in the papal chair two years and five months, following
Leo. She is said to have been a girl, called Agnes, of the
nation of MainZ, was led about by her paramour in a man's
dress in Athens and named John Anglicus. She made such
progress in different studies that, coming to Rome, she read
the trivium to an audience of great teachers. Finally, elected
pope, she was with child by her paramour, and, as she was
proceeding from St. Peter’s to the Lateran‚ she had the pains
of labor in a narrow street between the Colosseum and St.
Clement's and gave birth to a child. Shortly afterward she
died there and was buried. For this reason it is said that
all the popes avoid this street. Therefore‚ she is not put
down in the catalogue of popes.''

As ior a heretic occupying the papal chair we have an in-
stance in Liberius, of whom Castrensis writes, IV [Rolls Ser„
5 : 158], that at Constantius’s command he was exiled for

¹ This story oi the female Pope Agnes (John vm, about 855), to which Huss
refers again and again in his writings (Doc.‚ 59, 61; Mon„ 1 : 323, 324, 326, 336,
339, 343, 34 5, 347) as a proof that the papacy is not necessary to the being oi the
church, was fully believed in his time. Gerson used it to prove that the church
may err in matters of fact, and a bust of Agnes was included among the busts
of the other popes in the cathedral of Siena in the beginning of the fifteenth
century. Dietrich of Nieheim names the very school in which she taught.
So iar as the story can be traced, it was first told by Martin von Troppau—
Martinus Polonus-d. 1278, in his Chronicles. It is now discredited, and the
invention regarded as a satire upon the rule of meretricious women over worth-
less and wicked popes in the ninth and tenth centuries. See Mirbt‚ p. 973
D'ollinger: F ables of the M iddle A ges.

² Castrensis or Cestrensis, a derivative of Chester-castra, the name by
which Ranulph Higden was often quoted, the author of the Polychronicon or
U niversal H istory, in seven books, ed. by Babington and Lumby in Rolls Series,
1865 sqq„ 9 vols. The ed. gives the Latin text and also two Engl. translations,
one by Trevisa and the other by an unknown writer of the fifteenth century.
Nothing is known of the author except that he was a Benedictine monk of St.
Werburgh‚ Chester. He wrote probably after the middle of the fourteenth cen-
tury. The historical part begins with Abraham and continues to the reign of
Edward ΙΙΙ, 1312—1377. The work was widely circulated and the author gives
a list of the writers upon whom he has drawn. The quotation in regard to
Joan, vol. VI, 330, Cestrensis draws from Martinus Polonus.
