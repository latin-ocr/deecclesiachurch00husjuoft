xvi INTRODUCTION

historical data upon the Chronicles of Ranulph Higden‚ Mar-
tinus Polonus, and Rudolph Glaber.¹

Repeatedly did Huss return to the list of popes heretical
and popes flagitious. The rudest layman, a woman, a here-
tic, yea antichrist himself may be a pope.² But in none
os these lists does the name of Honorius I appear, the pon-
tiff on whose case Bishop Hefele, in 1870, rested the argu-
ment against the doctrine of papal infallibility.

Among the heretical popes Huss included Boniface VIII
and Clement VII of the fourteenth century and, as more
recent cases of papal errors, he cited the acts of Boniface IX
setting aside Wenzel as king of the Romans and Sigismund
as king of Hungary. During his trial Huss had another in-
stance at hand of a disreputable pontiff in John XXIII,
accepted by almost the whole of Western Christendom and
then deposed for crimes and iniquities unspeakable. Huss
also recalled that Gregory XII and Benedict XIII were pro-
nounced heretics by the council of Pisa.³

But the case on which Huss laid most stress was the pa-
pissa Agnes wh0‚ according to the universal opinion of his
time, occupied under the name of John VIII the papal office
for more than two years. Gerson used her as a proof that
it is possible for the church to err. It was monstrous‚ so
Huss thought, for a female to rule Christendom, and such a
female—a woman of unsavory repute before she was made
pope and revealing her sex by the sudden birth of a child
on one of the streets of the holy city.⁴

¹ Especially chap. XVII. Huss also presented these views from the pulpit.
See Life os Huss, p. 38.

²Mon.‚ 1 ε 342. In his Theol. Symbolics‚ p. 231, Doctor Briggs brushae
aside the case of Honorius Ι as not pertinent, without even mentioning the
names of Dtsshnger, Hefele, and other eminent Catholic historians who have
taken the view that he was manifestly a heretic.

⁸ Mon., 1 z 232. Though the council of Pisa was treated as oecumenicas
by the council of Constance and was formerly accepted by accredited Roman
Catholic historians, it is now universally disowned in the Catholic church.
