168 THE CHURCH

not love but hate, not truth but lying, urged them on and
ignorance of God’s law led thern astray, did they err gravely.

Equally, there may be a leading astray in the case of the
pope and cardinals, our doctors themselves being included,
that they should condemn some truth or other. For if the
apostles, chosen by Christ, who received the Holy Spirit,
fell into heresy, as St. Augustine and Bede affirm, how is
.it that the pope and cardinals have received greater gifts of
the Spirit, making it impossible for them to stray off in the
same degree or even in a larger degree? And it is not a mat-
ter of doubt that obedience should be rendered to pope and
cardinals so long as they teach the truth according to God's
law, as the authority says: “They shall pronounce for thee
a sentence of truth, and thou shalt do whatsoever they say
and whatsoever they teach thee according to His law.'' But
if the rabbins‚ that is, the teachers or great men, as Lyra says,
or popes or cardinals charge or admonish anything besides
the truth, even though the whole Roman curia is on their
side, the faithful is not to obey when he knows the truth,
for God says: “Thou shalt not follow after the multitude
to do evil.''1 Daniel, Nicodemus and the thief on the cross
put this principle into practise, who would not fall in with
the crowds in condemning the truth‚ as the Scripture states.
For Daniel condemned as naught the sentence of the elders
of the children of Israel by liberating Susanna and pronounc-
ing against the senior elders from whom the iniquity started,

¹In his treatises against John XXIII’s bulls, M on., 215-235, Huss asserts
the fallibility of popes and that they are not always to be obeyed. Popes
do not know whether they themselves are among the predestinate, not to
speak of others. Many popes who gave indulgences are lost.

work gives the story of the attempt on the virtue of a beautiful married woman,
Susanna, by two elders of Israel. Rejecting their proposal rather than incur
God’s condemnation, she was nevertheless accused by her would-be seducers
and sentenced to death. Daniel then intervened, proved the charges false,
and Susanna’s accusers were put to death.
