have ratified errors and heresies‚ for they were heretics them-
selves.

Hence the text, Dist. 24, in nomine Domini [Friedberg,
1 : 78], describes how the pope laments because that [apos-
tolical] seat has often been smitten with the frequent dinl
of simoniacal heresy. Therefore, wishing to provide a rem-
edy for the future, he [Nicolas II] decreed that, at the pope's
death, the cardinals, the religious, clerics and laymen, shall
meet together for the election of a suitable pope from the
bosom of that church or from the bosom of some other, wher-
ever the most fit might happen to be found, and that the
privilege of the emperor, Henry, should always be honored,
namely, that he and his successors shall have the right to
be present at the pope’s election.2 But a true pope being
elected, he shall have before his consecration, following the
example of St. Gregory, power to dispose of the goods of the
church, and every one who should hinder this ordinance he
might anathematize as a most wicked antichrist. Here the
Glossa ordinaria says, that at this point is plainly touched
upon what is read in the Chronicles, how Benedict, who suc-
ceeded Stephen, was ejected from the pontifical office, and
for a money consideration John, bishop of Sabina, was made
pope, to whom the name Sylvester was given. But he in
turn was cast down and Benedict restored, and Benedict was
again ejected and the papacy given to John, archpriest at
the Latin Gate, on whom was imposed the name Gregory.
And he was cast down by the emperor Henry and trans-
ferred beyond the mountains3 and these things all happened
in a single year. On ,account of these things that privilege
was given to Henry.³ Thus much the Glossa of the Decretum.

²The decree of Nicolas ΙΙ, 1059, confining election of the pope to the col-
lege of cardinals. The rule was soon after set aside in the case of the electiori
of Gregory VII, 1073. The emperor, Henry III, at Suu-i, 1046, dictated the
election of his chaplain as Clement ΙΙ. For Nicolas's edict, Mirbt, p. 110.

present, having come south to Rome to rid the church of the scandal of having
