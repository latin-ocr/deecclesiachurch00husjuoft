papers, had it not been for the fact that it confirmed Louis
the Fair of France in his opposition to the temporal abso-
lutism of the papal throne and united his kingdom around
him in this interest. Groups of pamphleteers in Italy and
France attacked now the claims of the papacy to secular
authority, as Dante, and now its spiritual claims‚ as Peter Du-
bois and Marsiglius of Padua. These men agreed in repu-
diating Constantine's donation on the ground that Constan-
tine had no right to bestow upon the Roman pontifi any
such power; and Marsiglius went far along the line of making
the claims which the Protestant Reformers afterwards united
in making} This keen critic, who was anathematized by
John XXII for asserting that Peter was not the head of the
church‚ also asserted that the distinction between bishops
and priests is not founded in Scripture and that the church
has no authority to coerce by physical measures. Con-
temporary with him, Ockam was also affirming that Christ
did not appoint a primacy at Rome and that the pope is not
essential to the church but is of human appointment-ex

church as “the cormnunity of the faithful comprehending
clerics and laymen.'' It may be reduced to one person as it
was to Mary when the disciples fied. A generation before,
Philip the Fair had proudly reminded Boniface that the
church was made up of laymen as well as priests.

The removal of the papacy to Avignon and the papal
schism which followed, 1377—1415‚ were adapted to intensify
the controversy over the nature and functions of the church‚

above quoted, also said that “the church is comprised of laymen and clerics, as
it were the two sides of one body.” To the laity‚ Hugo goes on to say, are
committed terrestrial possessions, ete.
