150 THE CHURCH

ters of doctrine much more profitable than all the cardinals,
from the first cardinals down to those now in office. For, in
the government of the church, he knew the Scriptures of
Christ better than they and also defined the nature of the
catholic faith better by clearing the church of heretical errors
and correcting them. Why, therefore, were those four doc-
tors not true vicars of the apostles and their manifest suc-
cessors‚ nay, even more true and reliable, so far as the people
go, than any modern pope with his cardinals who shine be-
fore the people neither by virtue of a holy life nor by doc-
trine? Therefore, do I boldly assert that, if in any point
these four doctors agree, the pope and his cardinals may
not lawfully declare the opposite as the saith of the people.
And the same is true of other saints, such as John Chrysos-
tom, John of Damascus and Dionysius the Areopagite, who,
taught by the Holy Spirit, illuminated the church of Christ
by their knowledge and piety.

Against this point it is argued chiefly in this way: God is
omnipotent‚ therefore, God may give other true successors of
the apostles than are the pope and the cardinals. Therefore‚
other true successors of the apostles can be found or given
who are not the pope or the cardinals. Hence that [sixth]
point is false and the first consequence is proved. For, if
God is not able to give other true successors‚ than are the
pope and the cardinals, it follows that the power of Caesar,
a man and not God, in setting up the pope and cardinals
limited God's power, a thing which is false. Hence the con-
sequence is proven, for Constantine, the Caesar‚ three hun-
dred years after Christ, instituted the pope; because the
Roman pontiff was an associate of other pontiffs until the
donation of Caesar by whose authority the pope began to
rule as head. Hence the Decretum, Dist. 96 : 14 [Friedberg,
1 : 342 sq.],¹ which out of reverence we cannot deny, thus

part of the spurious decretal of Pope Gelasius. The preceding decretal con-
