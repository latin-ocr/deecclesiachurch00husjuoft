CHAPTER IV

CHRIST THE ONLY HEAD OF THE CHURCH

IN view of what has been said, the conclusion is (1) that
Christ alone is the head of the universal church, which church
is not a part of anything else. This is clear because, if any one
is the head of the universal church‚ then is he made better
than the angels and than any blessed created spirit, Heb.
1 : 43 but this befits Christ alone, for it behooved him to be
the first-born among many brethren‚ Romans, 8:29, and
consequently it behooves him to be the chief by the right of
the law of primogenitum, Col. 1 : 15. This conclusion also
follows from the apostle's words, Eph. 1 : 20: “Which God
wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and
made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, far
above all rule and authority, power and dominion‚ and every
name which is named not only in this world but also in the
world which is to come, and has put all things under his feet
and gave him to be head over all things to the church‚ which
is his body.’' From this it is clear that, if any Christian were
to be the head of the universal church with Christ (for the
church cannot be a monster having two heads, as is set forth
in Boniface VIII's bun, beginning Unam sanctam· therefore,

not two heads, like a monster '’), it would be necessary to
concede that the Christian who was the head of that church
was Christ himself, or otherwise it would be necessary to
concede that Christ is inferior to that Christian and a lowly
member of him. The conclusion shows that the thing is im-
possible. Hence, the holy apostles agreed in confessing that
