178 THE CHURCH

And, as is gathered from the Chronicles of Martin‚ Cas-
trensis and Rudolph,l (1) Pope Boniface was presiding at
Rome A. D. 420, and Eulalius having been ordained in
opposition to him and the church being divided on the ques-
tion, both by the command of Honorius Augustus left the
city; and, Eulalius being condemned, Boniface, who had pre-
viously been ordained, was by the command of Augustus re-
stored to the apostolic seat.²

(2) A. D. 493 Laurentius was ordained over against
Pope Symmachus by a dissident faction.3

(3) A. D. 768 the schismatic pope Constantine was de-
prived of his eyes, and Stephen was made pope. The latter
assembled a synod at Rome and reordained those who had
been ordained by the schismatic Constantine.4

(4) A. D. 873 Pope Anastasius invaded the praesulate as
against Benedict.5

three contemporary popes and to receive the imperial crown. As before said,
Benedict IX, a dissolute fellow, was opposed by an antipope‚ Sylvester III,
elected by the Romans, and, wishing to marry, sold the papacy to Gregory VI.
All three were disposed of at Sutri and Clement ΙΙ elected.

¹ Martinus Polonus, d. 1278, whose work, de Imperatoribus et Pontificibus,
was one of the most esteemed chronicles of the later M. A. Rudolph is Radul-
phus Glaber‚ a monk of Cluny, about 1050, who wrote Historia sui temporis,
Migne, vol. 142. Castrensis was Ranulph of Higden.

²After the death of Zosimus, Eulalius was chosen pope by a part of the
clergy and consecrated 418. The day before the consecration Boniface I
was elected by another part of the clergy. Honorius recognized Boniface and
expelled Eulahus, who died 423, a year after Boniface, refusing to stand again
for election to the papal chair.

³Symmachus‚ 498-514. Both were consecrated, one in the Lateran and
Laurentius in the S. Maria Magg. Laurentius at first submitted and was
made bishop of Nocera, Campania, but his party pressed his case, and it was
not till four years had passed that, forced by the decrees of synods and the
attitude of Theodoric, he withdrew permanently from Rome.

⁴ Stephen III, 768-772. The antipope Constantine ΙΙ, the creature of his
brother, Duke Toto, was deposed by a Lateran synod, 769, which also enacted
a rule against the election of laymen to the papal chair. Constantine's eyes
were put out, as Huss has said before.

⁶ Benedict III, 855-858. Anastasius had resisted Benedict’s predecessor,
Leo IV, and, receiving the support of the imperial legates, forced his way into
the Lateran and had Benedict torn from his throne. The clergy and people
of Rome were against him and he was obliged to withdraw. Of his end there
is no credible account.
