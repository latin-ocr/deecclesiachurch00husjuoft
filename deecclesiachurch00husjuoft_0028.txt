not wish that men should be put to death—nec voluit civiliter
judicare nec morte corporis condemnare voluit.¹ It is true that
before d’Ailly and the commission at Constance Huss modi-
fied this statement, declaring that the suspected heretic
should be labored with and instructed and only then, if neces-
sary, punished corporally. As thus modified‚ the statement
started a tumult among those present. And, when Huss
went on to say that the priests and scribes who delivered
Christ to Pilate had the greater sin, the tumult was repeated.
It is possible that Huss was moved by the sufferings he was
undergoing to make this modification, but exactly what he
meant is not 616ε11.2

crusade against Ladislaus, he repudiated the right of a pon-
tiff to call for war against Christians in the absence of a
special command from God. He denied the application of
the cases of the Old Testament and Sapphira to Christian
officials in the ordinary exercise of their authority. Only an
express command from above would justify the use of the
death penalty. Nor is torture to be applied to Christians.
When Christ wished to defend himself against his enemies‚
he “meekly bore their attacks and did good to his detrac-
tors,'' an example priests should follow. By word and ex-
ample Christ commended peace—ad pacem ducit verbo et
exempl0.³

In dealing with Augustine's use of the passage “compel
them to come in‚'' Huss affirmed that it is one thing to compel
and quite another to exterminate or kill. The death penalty
for heretics was never expressly recommended by Augustine,
and it is probable that Huss more nearly represented the views
and spirit of the African Father than did the Schoolmen
and the council of Constance. The armor of the chureh,
Huss insisted, is not carnal but spiritual as set forth in the
