ROMAN PONTIF F AND CARDINALS 61

theless the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church is by
the decisions of no synods¹ set above the other churches.''
This it proves by the passage already cited, Matt. 16—
namely: “Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build
my church.'’ And a little later it calls this church “the
Roman church, the primal seat of the apostle, which has
neither spot nor wrinkle.'' This church, however, cannot
be understood to mean the pope with his cardinals and his
household, for they alike come and go. Therefore‚ the Gloss
on this text has this to say: “The argument is, that wherever
the good are, there is the Roman church.'’ And so the De-
cretum, 24 : 1 [Friedberg 1 : 97o]: a recta is to be understood.
Where the canon on the Roman church speaks in this way:
“This is the holy and apostolic mother church of all the
churches of Christ, which2 by God’s omnipotent grace is
proved never to have erred from the path of apostolic tra-
dition, nor has ever been corrupted by or succumbed to
heretical novelties.'' This, it must here be noted, cannot
be understood of any pope or the members of his household,
on which point the Gloss also says: “I ask, therefore, of which
church do you understand that it cannot err?’' But it is
certain that the pope can err. See Decretum, Anastasius, 19,
and Si papa, 40 [Friedberg, 1 : 64, 146]. Therefore. neither
the pope himself nor his family is that church of which it is
here said, she cannot err. Hence the Gloss says: “The
company of the faithful itself is called this church.'' So also
is to be understood St. Jerome's statement, Dist. 2 5: 1, Haec
est fides [Friedberg 1 :970]: “The Roman church is holy,
which always has remained thoroughly unspotted, will in the
future by the Lord's providence and the blessed Apostle
Peter’s care remain without any dent from heretics and abide

¹ Instead of “no synods” Huss's text has “many—multis——synod53’ The
text of the Decretum is nullis. This was the famous decree of Gelasius‚ pope
about 495 or 496, and I have substituted the right reading above; for the mis-

take of the editor makes Huss prove the very opposite of what he was intending.
² Huss here has qui, the Decretum qzcae.
