GOOD AND BAD IN THE CHURCH 49

multitude of saints. But we know imperfectly and indis-
tinctly enough those who are now pilgrims and those who are
sleeping. But when that which is perfect is come that which
is in part shall vanish away, because in heaven we shall dis-
tinguish our mother clearly and also her individual members.
And let not the faithful [Christian] complain but rejoice in
the truth that holy mother church is to so great a degree un-
known to him here on the way, because over him stands the
merit of Christian saith. For, according to the apostle, Heb.

not move a man to believe what is false. Howbeit good may
come by a false faith under certain circumstances, and how-
beit God moves to the essence of an act, nevertheless, God
does not so move a man that the man is deceived. There-
fore, if a layman believes about his prelate that he is a holy
