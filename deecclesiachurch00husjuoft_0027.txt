crusades for the extirpation of heresy with the sword in
Southern F rance. Thomas Aquinas, d. 1274, made the sol-
emn statement that as coin-clippers, who offend against the
majesty of the state, are put to death, so heretics‚ who
offend against the church‚ deserve to be put out of the
world.

This principle was incorporated in the civil codes of the
Schwabenspiegel and Sachsenspiegel and in the laws of Fred-
erick 11 who proscribed death in the flames for heretics. In
accordance with the old axiom that the church does not de-
sire blood-ecclesiam non sitit sanguinem-it did not of itself
execute the death sentence. However, it was participant in
the execution, for it threatened civil magistrates with severest
spiritual penalties who hesitated to execute it. Gregory IX
demanded from the Roman senator a promise to search out
heretics and to put them to death within eight days of their
condemnation by the ecclesiastical tribunal. Louis IX, in
France, and parliament by its act of 1401, in England‚ in-
troduced the law of death. The horrors of the system os
torture were authorized by Innocent IV, the successor of
Gregory IX. Later, it remained for Sixtus IV in 1478 to
open the second volume in the history of the horrors of the
mediaeval inquisition by sanctioning the holy office of
Spain.¹

Thus, by papal assumption and scholastic definition and
state legislation‚ the claim was made to the awiul power of
shutting up dissenters eternally in hell and of depriving them
of life on the earth.

In opposing this usage, Huss appealed to the example of
Christ and the purpose of the Gospel. Christ did not as-
sume civil authority. He refused the title of king. He did

man is a heretic who attacks the papal prerogatives,'' Letters of Lord Acton to
