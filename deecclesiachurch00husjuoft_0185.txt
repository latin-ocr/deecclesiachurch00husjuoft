THE POPE NOT THE CHURCH'S HEAD 131

the successor of the prince of the apostles, Peter. (4) Cardi-
nals are manifest and true successors of the college of Christ’s
other apostles. (5) For the government of the church
throughout the whole world, there should always be manifest
and true successors of the same kind in the office of the prince
of the apostles and in the office of Christ's other apostles.
(6) Such successors are not to be found or procured on the
earth, other than the pope, the existing head and the college
of cardinals, the existing body of the church.

Against all these six points, the argument in brief runs
thus: all truth in the religion of Christ is to be followed and
only that is truth which is known by the bodily senses, or
discovered by an infallible intelligence, or made known through
revelation, or laid down in sacred Scripture. But none of
these six points is truth known by the bodily senses or dis-
covered by an infallible intelligence or known through rev-
elation, or laid down in divine Scripture. Therefore, no one
of these six points is truth in the religion of Jesus Christ
which is to be followed. The major premise is seen in what
St. Augustine says, Enchiridion, 4 [Nic. Fathers, 3 ε 238l:
“These things chiefly, yea almost exclusively, are to be fol-
lowed in religion, and he who contradicts them is altogether
a stranger to the name of Christ or he is a heretic. . . .
These things are to be defended by the reason whether they
start from the bodily senses or are discovered by the intelli-
gence of the mind. But these things, which we have not
been aware of through the bodily senses or been able to reach
with the mind, nor now are able—these are beyond doubt to
be believed on the testimony of those witnesses by whom the
Scriptures‚ deservedly called divine, were written, because,
assisted with divine help, they were able to see these things
or to foresee them either through the bodily senses or through
the mind.'’ Thus much St. Augustine.

The minor premise, however, the doctors are unable to
disprove unless one of these six points should be revealed to
