 

THE CHURCH WITHOUT POPE 151

speaks: “The emperor Constantine on the fourth day after
his baptism conferred on the pontiff the grant—privilegium
—of the Roman church that the pontifis might have head-
ship in all the earth, as judges over the king.’' In this grant,
this among other things is read: “We have bestowed upon
him power and ability and imperial honor, seeing that he is
thus to hold the government over the four sees, Alexandria,
Antioch‚ Jerusalem and Constantinople, and is the highest
ruler over all priests in the whole world,'' etc. See how the
institution and pre-eminence of the pope emanated from
Caesar's power, which, however, cannot lirnit God’s power.
For this reason later pontiffs, fearing that they might lose
their pre-eminence, sought confirmation from other Caesars,
as the Decretum, Dist. 63 [Friedberg, 1 : 244]‚ says: “I, Lewis,
Roman emperor, Augustus, do decree and bestow by this our
act of confirmation upon thee, blessed Peter, prince of the
apostles, and through thee upon thy vicar, Lord Pascal, su-
preme pontiff, and upon thy successors forever, even as by our
[your] predecessors ye have up to this time held in our [your]
power and gift alone and controlled the Roman state.”l

But there need be no anxiety over this grant of words
when Caesar says: “I, Lewis, concede unto thee, blessed
Peter.'’ Never did Peter, who at that time was already in
possession of the kingdom of heaven, stand in need of civil
possession over Rome, and never was Lewis greater than
Peter and more truly in possession than Peter. Would that
Peter, if it had been God’s will, had said: Ι do not accept

tains the express assertion of Constantine’s donation: “The emperor Constan-
tine bestowed upon the apostolic see the crown and all royal authority in the
city of Rome and in Italy and in the regions of the West.''

¹Huss’s text departs from the original substituting nostris for vestris, and
nostra for vestra, the original reading, “even as by your predecessors ye have
held in your own power and gift and disposed of the city of Rome with its
duchy and all the suburban regions and towns, its hilly territory, and its sea-
coast line and harbors and all cities, strongholds, walled towns and villas in the
regions of Tuscany‚” etc. This pact between Lewis and Pascal, 817—824, is
first found in Anselm of Lucca, d. 1073, and is deemed altogether spurious or at
least largely interpolated.
