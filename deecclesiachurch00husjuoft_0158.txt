104 THE CHURCH

standing this passage appropriate something of the arrogance
of the Pharisees so as to think that they can damn the guilt-
less and loose offenders, for with God not the judgment of
priests is sought but the life of the guilty.”1 To these words
the Master of Sentences‚ 4 : 18, cap. 6, adds [Migne’s ed.‚
p. 37 5]: “Here it is plainly shown, that God does not follow
the sentence of the church which judges in ignorance and
deceitfully.'' He also adds, cap. 8: “Sometimes he who is
sent outdoors‚ that is, outside of holy church, by the priest,
is, nevertheless, inside. And he who, by virtue of the truth,
is outside, seems to be kept inside by the priest's false sen-
tence.'’ And again he says, 4 : 19, cap. 4 [Migne, p. 382]:
That the priest who binds and looses others ought himself
to be prudent and just, for otherwise he will put to death
souls who do not die and revive souls which do not live, and
in this way he turns his power of pronouncing judgment into
an instrument of cursing——so that it is said in Mal. 2 : 2:
“1 will bless your cursings and curse your blessings.” There-
fore the vicars of Christ ought to take heed that they do
not lightly presume to bind or loose whenever it pleases
them.

But the objection is offered concerning higher rank and
obedience from the Canon Solitoe [Friedberg, 2 ε Ῑ96-Ῑ99],
where Pope Innocent [III] says: “The Lord said to Peter,
and in Peter to his successors, ‘Whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven,’ making no exception
when he said, ‘Whatsoever,' etc.’' Here it is to be noted
that in virtue of the words, “Whatsoever thou shalt loose,’'
Peter could not loosen the Scriptures, for Christ our Saviour
said: “The Scripture cannot be broken,'' John 10 : 35.

¹Jerorne adds that, according to Lev. 14, the lepers were commanded to
show themselves to the priest and, if they had leprosy, they became unclean
by the priest—a sacerdote immundi fiant—“not that the priests made them
leprous and unclean, but that the leprous and those who were not might have
the knowledge of their condition.” For Huss's treatment of the power of the
keys as set forth in his Com. on Peter the Lombard, see Introduction to this
volume.
