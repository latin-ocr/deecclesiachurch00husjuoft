88 THE CHURCH

as follows: “Among these things thou walkest in the van a
Shepherd overornamented with gold even in the midst of
an environment so varied. Why do they seize the sheep?
If I may dare, I will say that these are the pasture grounds
of demons rather than of sheep. Not in this wayl did Peter
act, or Paul frisk about.'' And he adds: “Either deny to
the people that thou art shepherd or show thyself such.
Thou wilt not deny it lest he whose place thou holdest deny
thee to be the heir. He is Peter who is not known to go
about in processions‚ omamented with gems or silks‚ not clad
in gold or carried by a white horse, or compassed about with
soldiers, and surrounded by bustling servants. Without such
things, Peter believed he was able to fulfil sufficiently the
salutary commandment: ‘If thou lovest me, feed my sheep.'
In things like these thou hast followed not Peter, but Con-
stantine.'’ Thus far Bernard.

That holy man knew that Pope Eugenius ought to be a
vicar in poverty and humility, not in pride but in feeding
the sheep, following Peter. For that man is a true vicar
of him whose place he fills and from whom he has lawfully
received the procuratorial power. But no one can truly and
acceptably to Christ rule in Christ's stead or the stead of
Peter without following him in his life—moribus ²—since there
is no other fitting way of following him except he receive
subject to this condition from God procuratorial power. Thus

quoted by Huss, also in other writings‚ and by the title ad Eugenium. Although
Eugenius was his spiritual son, Bernard addressed him as “most holy father.”
He recalls the pope from the love of pomp and wealth to spiritual humility
and the proper business of the pope who, although pastor of pastors, is greatest
when he is servant of all. He is in the line of the primacy of Abel, Abraham,
Moses, Aaron, and Peter. Both Ultramontanes and Gallicans claim the treatise
for their position. Bp. Reinkens's trsl.‚ Miinster‚ 1870, pp. 170, the Old Catholic
divine, represented the second view. Besides the ed. of Migne, Schneider's ed„
Berlin, 1850. The passage quoted is Schneider, pp. 75 sq. Reinkens, pp. 114,
116. See Schaff, Ch. Hist„ V, pt. 1 : 776 sq.

1Νοη sic. Bernard has scilicet, the words being spoken in irony. Below
Huss has neges instead of neget, deny.

² Literally‚ morals denoting the disposition or principles as well as the out-
ward act.
