 

THE CARDINALS 145

of the body of the Saviour. But in allowing himself to
be kissed the pope is altogether guilty, because he cannot
make himself equal to Christ so as to deserve such honor.
And if he may equal Christ (though he will not quickly
equal the apostles), yet should he not exceed in honors of
this kind what they received, unto the increase of his merit,
and by a similar confession, for the profit of the people doing
honor. Therefore, they, like Christ, began to do good by
excelling in good works and not by receiving kisses, given as
unto God. For they despised mundane honors and for that
reason forbade men to make genuflections in their presence.
For they kept in memory Christ's words: “When thou art
bidden to a marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat,
lest a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him, and
he that bade thee and him shall come to thee and say, Friend,
give this man place3 and then thou shalt begin with shame
to take the lowest place,” Luke 14 ε 8, 9.

But it is certain from the sayings of the saints that Christ
is speaking of the spiritual and not the corporal vocation,
place and meal, for by the wedding is intended the marriage
of Christ and the church which will be fulfilled perpetually
in the last supper. To this marriage feast many are called,
and few are chosen, as Christ said, Matt. 22 z 14, but he
sits in the lowest place who, with a good heart, esteems him-
self the least of the elect, just as did Christ's apostle, who
saw into the secret things which it is not lawful for a man
to utter and esteemed himself the least of the apostles. If,
therefore, the pope esteems himself to be the most holy father,
or consents to receive from his inferiors the address, “Most
Holy F ather,'' does he not in presumption choose the first
place? Therefore, if he had humility, such as St. Gregory
had, he would with all haste put a stop to this style of ad-
dress or seek to put a stop to it. Not because he holds the
place of Peter and because he holds the great dotation, is he
most holy—-sanctz'ssimus—-but if he follows Christ in humility,
