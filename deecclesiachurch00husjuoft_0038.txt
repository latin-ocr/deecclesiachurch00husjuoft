1524, said that the new views were “not a question of some
pernicious novelty, but only that new arms were being added

But what Wyclif's Bible was to the small company of
dissenters in England, Huss's Treatise on the Church was

and followed, in part or in whole, his views.

Huss were agreed and, in 1520, an edition was printed in
Mainz by Ulrich von Hutten.² Wyclif was not quoted by
the Reformers. They knew him through Huss.
