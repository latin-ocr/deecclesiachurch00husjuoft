xviii IN TRODUCTION

of the early rulers of the church‚ so that the demons could
say of them: “Paul I know and Peter I know, but who are
you?’' With Gregory the Great, Huss affirmed that the
name does not make the bishop but the life.¹

One of the conclusions drawn in this treatise, as also in
other treatises from Huss's hand, is that the church once
got along very well without popes. And she might get along
well without them again, Chapter XV.

A second conclusion was that papal decrees are not al-
ways to be obeyed. To rebel against an erring pope Huss
boldly said was to obey God. So clear and emphatic were
Huss's views on this subject that Luther declared that “Huss
committed no more atrocious sin than to profess that a pope
of an impious life is not the head of the church catholic.
He conceded he was the head of a church, but not of the
catholic church. Truly he ought to have said: ‘No matter
how criminal and wicked the pontifex maximus is yet ought
he to be venerated for sanctity. He cannot err and all that
he says and does is to be accepted and treated as an article
of the saith! The good men at Constance disposed of three
wicked popes and would not allow them to be taken to the
fire: but Huss was sentenced to death.''²

3. The Power of the Keys. Huss’s chief statements are
as follows: The Apostles, as has already been said, were all
the immediate vicars of Christ, Peter’s authority not being
universal and total but partial and particular. Without
recourse to Peter the remaining Apostles ordained bishops
and presbyters, taught and pastured.³ Thomas, the Apostle
to India, was not appointed by Peter, nor was Matthias.

tion we easily think of Thomas Aquinas who, visiting the pope, was shown the
treasures of the Vatican with the words: “ See, Thomas, Peter could no more
say, ‘Silver and gold have I none’''; to which Thomas replied: “Nor could
he now say, ‘ Rise upon thy feet and walk.”'
