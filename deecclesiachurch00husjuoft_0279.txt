ECCLESIASTICAL SUPERIORS 2 2 5

for the horse or the ass, discerning the hole in front of them
and urged on by spurs, avoid the ditch so far as they can,
as is clear from the case of the ass, which discerned the angel
forbidding, lest it go the way Balaam wanted to go [Num.
22 : 22], and, with a man's voice, admonished the prophet's
unwisdom. Hence, Bernard says ironically in his letter to
the monk Adam: “Thou‚ that most obedient son, thou, that
most devoted disciple—as for that thy father and teacher,
whom neither by an instant of time nor a turn of the foot,
as they say, thou didst suffer to be removed from thee as
long as he lived—after him not with blind eyes, but after
the manner of Balaam, with open eyes, thou didst not hesi-
tate to fall down into the pit!’' So much Bernard.

From these truths, however, it follows further that cler-
ical inferiors, and much more laics, may sit in judgment on
the works of their superiors. From this it follows that the
judgment by discreet and hidden arbitrament in the court
of conscience is one thing, and the judgment in virtue of the
empowered jurisdiction in the court of the church is another.
By the first way the inferior ought chiefly to examine and
judge himself, as it is written: “If we would judge1 ourselves,
we would not be judged,'' Ι Cor. 11 ε 31. And again, in the
same way, he ought to judge all things pertaining to his
salvation as it is written: “He that is spiritual judgeth all
things,'' I Cor. 2 ε 15. The laic also ought to examine and
judge the works of his superior, as the apostle judged the
works of Peter, when he corrected him and said: “When I
saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth
of the Gospel, I said unto Cephas before them all, If thou,
who art a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles and not as do the
Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to walk as do the
Jews?’' Gal. 2 : 14. Secondly, the laic ought to examine and
judge his superior for the purpose of fleeing, for Christ said:
“Beware of false prophets which come unto you in sheep’s
