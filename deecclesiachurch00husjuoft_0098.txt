44 THE CHURCH

dred and fifty and three great fishes, caught on the right side
of the boat, stand for the predestinate, amongst whom, other
things being equal‚ are the greater ones who teach and do
God's commandments.

As for the fifth proof from the Gospel: “He shall baptize
you in the Holy Spirit, etc.‚'' it is conceded that holy church
is the Lord's threshing-floor in which are now mingled together
in virtue of saith the good and the bad, predestinate and
reprobate; the predestinate as the wheat, and the reprobate
as the chaff. The first shall be gathered into the heaVenly
garner, the rest burnt with fire unquenchable‚ as say the
Gospel and Augustine's exposition. And as the chaff always
remains chaff‚ so a reprobate always remains reprobate, even
though for a time he may be in grace according to present
righteousness. Nevertheless, he is never a part of holy church.
And just as the wheat always remains wheat‚ so the predesti-
nate always remains predestinate and a member of the church,
howbeit for a time he may fall away frorn accidental grace,
but never from the grace of predestination. On this subject
Augustine, 32 : 4, C. Recurrat [Friedberg‚ 1 : 1127], thus
expresses himself: “Thereiore‚ whether they seem to be turned
over within or are evidently outside, what is fiesh is flesh;¹
or whether they continue in their sterility on the threshing-
fioor or are carried away on occasion of temptation as by a
wind without, what is chaff is chaff3 and he will always be
separated from the unity of the church, which is without spot
and wrinkle‚ who continues in carnal obduracy and is mingled
with the company of the saints. Nevertheless, of no one
should we despair, neither of him who appears to be of this
kind and is within, nor of him who is outside and is more
manifestly whirled about.”2 Thus much Augustine.

¹ I have corrected Huss's text from the text of the Corp. jur. can. For ex-
ample, Huss has qui carior est, carior est for quod caro est caro est, and veritate
for unitate. The first part of the passage, “ to turn within‚'' has some reference
to the time before birth, in the womb. Augustine has been speaking of Re—
becca and the births of Jacob and Esau, and also of Sarah and Hagar.

² Huss text has manifestus and above veritate sor unitate—unity οἱ the church,
