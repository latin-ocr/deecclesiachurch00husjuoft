1 1 2 THE CHURCH

10 ε 9, “Get you no gold nor silver‚’' they shun as hurtful.
In the same way what he said to his disciples, John 20 : 23,
“Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whosesoever sins ye remit
they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye re-
tain they are retained,'' very placidly they accept. But what
he says in Matt. 11 : 29, “Learn of me for I am meek and
lowly of heart, '’ even the gentleness and meekness, which pre-
pare a place for the Holy Spirit‚ they do not admit to their
hearts.

Also what the Lord said to his disciples, Luke 10 ε 16,
“He that heareth you heareth me‚'’ they seize upon as mean-

20 ε 2 5, “Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles do lord it
over them and their great ones exercise authority over them.
Not so shall it be among you, but, whosoever would become
great among you, shall be your minister, and whosoever
would be first among you shall be your servant: even as the
Son of Man came not to be ministered unto but to minister,’'
—this most weighty saying they repudiate in word and deed

And that I may gather up briefiy all that the Scripture
says, and especially the Gospel: what seems to indicate to
them that they ought to be rich, live delicately, be famous
in the world, and suffer no reproach for Christ, these sayings
they ruminate over, proclaim aloud and make known all too
extensively. But whatever calls for the imitation of Christ,
as poverty, gentleness, humility, endurance, chastity, toil or
patience—these passages they suppress or gloss over at their
pleasure or expressly set aside as not pertaining to salva-
tion. And the devil, who is the worst of sophists‚ leads
them astray by their ignorance of the logical consequences,
arguing in this way: “Christ gave such authority to Peter
and the rest of the apostles, therefore also to you.'’ And
