30 THE CHURCH

the beginning even unto the end, and all the legions and
armies of the angels being also added—that so there might
be one city under one king, and one province under one
emperor, happy, lauding God in its never—ending peace and
salvation, and blessed without end. Christ's body, which is
the church, is, as it were, like a young man. And now in the
end of the world the church is of plump old age, because, with
reference to this, it was said of her: ‘They shall be multiplied
in her plump old age.' She has been multiplied among all
nations.'’ So much Augustine, in whose words it appears how
Christ is the head of the holy church, in whom the fathers
believed as the one who was for to come in virtue of
his humanity that he might be their head in his humanity
as he had always been present with them in his divinity.
And in this head all the elect are united, together with the
holy angels.

(2) The second point concerns the objection that no rep-
robate is a member of our holy mother, the Catholic church.
For, not only is our holy mother, the Catholic church, one
from the beginning of the world, which without mixture has
been embraced with never-ending love by the right hand of
the bridegroom, as is plain from what has been said above
and on Augustine's authority: Inasmuch as the church, after
the day of judgment, will have no other members than she has
and will have before the day of judgment, but all who are
to be saved after that day of judgment are predestinate,
therefore none of them, before that day of judgment are rep-
robate. And consequently no reprobates have ever been
members of the church, the bride of Christ. By the same kind
of reasoning this will always be true, that no reprobate what-
soever is a member of our holy mother, the Catholic church.

Likewise, it is not possible that at any time Christ does
not love his bride or any part of her, for he necessarily loves
her as he loves himself. But it is not possible that he should
love any reprobate in this way3 therefore it is not possible
