OBEDIENCE TO PRELATES 259

ing a remedy against the spots of his bride, and Paul con-
tradicts the idea that it is wanting, Gal. 5, ior he resisted
Peter, the pope, to his face for a light offence and also in his
writing left for those who were to come after, that in cases
of like falling away they should do the same to their brother.
Therefore, it is faithless to assert that the higher rank may
not have its fault told it in matters moral by an inferior.
Wherefore, in case of a fault, a son may lawfully tell his
father his fault, a daughter the mother, a subject the prel-
ate, a disciple his teacher—all following the rule of love.
However, against these things the objection is made that
the pope has the place of the Lord Jesus Christ on earth.
But it is not permitted any one to tell him his fault, as ap-
pears from Matt. 16. When, on account of Christ's rebuke,
Peter is called Satan, is it not, therefore, permitted to find
fault with him that occupies Peter's stead? But this kind
of reasoning includes too much, for it would necessitate say-
ing that every vicar of Christ is impeccable, just as Christ
is impeccable. But it is a good inference that neither pope
nor other person ought to be found fault with or corrected
in so far as they foHow the Head, Christ. But, if a bishop
or confessor occupying Christ's stead attempt an act of sels-
indulgence with a virgin or a chaste wife, ought he not to
be vehemently found fault with as if he were antichrist
and the faithless enemy of his own soul? For in committing
such an illicit act, he does not occupy Christ’s stead, but the
place of antichrist himself and the devil, tempting a woman
most iniquitously. And it is clear, that that statement of
St. Bernard which the doctors adduce, namely, that in those
things, that is, ‘things intermediate‚ it is certainly not right to
prefer our view to the sentence of the masters, and in these
neither the command nor the prohibition of prelates are alto-
gether to be spurned’—the circumstances must be understood
fitted to the act of obedience which is owed in respect to
the mode, place, time and person, as has been said. For often
the student with reason refuses to obey in an act intermediate
