xxvi INTRODUCTION ’

set forth in his Treatise on the Church, Huss found in the
writings of Wyclif and particularly in Wyclif's treatise on
v the same subject. Not only has he the main principles in
common with Wyclif, and also many oi his quotations from
the Fathers and the canon law and his proofs from Scrip-
- ture. Huss appropriated paragraph after paragraph from his
predecessor and transferred them often with little verbal
change to his own' pageS. The agreement has been convinc-
ingly shown by Loserth, who prints the corresponding para-
graphs side by side. It is not necessary here to repeat what
he has done.¹

Huss's reverend respect for Wyclis has already been indi-
cated. Whereas Stephen Palecz, Stanislaus of Znaim and
other theological colleague3‚ who at first shared his admira-
tion for the English teacher‚ came to regard his teaching as
honeyed poison—-mellatum venenum—Huss continued to bow
before him as the “master of deep thoughts.'’ And it was
for Wyclii's doctrines and, in a sense, in his stead he died at
Constance.²

The recent publication of Wyclif’s works beginning with
1883, under the auspices of the Wyclif society, has made

possible a full estimate of the obligation which Huss owed >

to his English predecessor. Up to that date only a compara—
tively small number of his writingS‚ English as well as
Latin, were in print, *and Wyclif's Treatise on the Church
appeared for the first time, 1886. In the light of Wyclif's
printed text, the theory advocated at length by Neander
that Huss was indebted to Matthias of Janow for his view
on the authority oi Scripture and other topics is found to be
wholly without foundation. And, in fact, nowhere does Huss
express any debt to that writer of Prague whO, by the way,
recanted his views which were pronounced erroneouS. N ever

Wyclif's de Ecclesia and his de potestate Papae, ed. by Loserth‚ 1907.
