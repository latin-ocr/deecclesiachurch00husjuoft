136 THE CHURCH

who is the head of the church‚ much more present with us
than the pope, who is removed from us two thousand miles
and incapable of influencing of himself our feeling or move-
ments? Let it suffice, therefore, to say, that the pope may
be the vicar of Christ and may be so to his profit, if he is a
faithful minister predestinated unto the glory of the head,
Jesus Christ.1

¹ The same thought is expressed in Reply to Palecz, M on., 1 : 321: “God
gave Christ to be the head over the militant church‚ that he might preside over
it most excellently without any hindrance of local distance . . . and pour into it,
as the head pours into the body, movement, feeling and a gracious life whether
there be no pope or a woman be pope.''
