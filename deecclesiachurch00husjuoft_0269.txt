THE APOSTOLIC SEE 215

transferred to Rome, over which we, with divine grace sup-
porting us, preside this very day. But if your Antiochjan
seat, which originally was the first, gave way to the Roman
seat, there is none which is not subject to its bestowal—
ditione.'’ See how very finely this pope begins and how
very confusedly he ends. In the first place, he asks and
begs that the priests of Antioch teach nothing else than
what they received from Peter and frorn other apostles and
holy Fathers. O that all clerics had done this! Then he
says, that the seat of Peter was the primary one among
them, that is, the first place of his residence, in which as
bishop he taught Christ's law. And this is true. But when
he says, “Afterwards it was transferred to Rome,’' that is,
Peter's seat—I certainly do not know what that seat was
that was transferred3 for no church, no locality, no people

Rome? But Pope Marcellus did not preside over Peter, nor
is Peter now the Roman seat. What, therefore, does this
expression ‘Over which,’ mean, when he says, “Over which
we preside.'' Certainly this pope speaks confusedly. For
after the dotation, the Roman bishop then living intended
that the Roman church by the authority of Caesar should
be called first, that is, the more worthy seat over which he
himself presides, and so he intended that the priests of An-

follow in the steps of Jesus Christ. And I will pass by the
way in which many popes and canonists speak obscurely
about the apostolic see. Ι will, however, not say that the
city of Rome is the apostolic seat, so necessary that with-
out it the church of Jesus Christ could not stand. For, if
