230 THE CHURCH

committing mortal sin, and so disobedience to authority in-
volves a serious offence. Therefore this statement, taken
from the proposition of the doctors, “the Roman church
and prelates are to be obeyed by inferiors in all things,’'
etc.‚ means this much: “that we ought to obey under pain
of mortal sin.''

Therefore‚ following this sense, they now cry out that
I am disobedient to the Roman church, and for this they
excommunicate me. And it is clear from God’s law and
from the canons that no one is to be excommunicated except
for mortal sin, as I have stated in another place.

Letting this proposition stand, I lay down this conclu-
sion, that to no apostolic seat of the Roman church, that
is, to no pope with the cardinals (as these are understood by
the doctors), and to no prelates do inferiors owe obedience
in all things which are neither purely good nor purely evil.

It is proved that king, marquis, duke, baron, soldier, citi-
zen or rustic is bound to obey under pain of morta] sin no
Roman church and no prelates so as to be prevented from
holding worldly possessions or from entering marriage. These
two things, the possession of goods and the entrance upon
marriage, belong, in the case of the persons mentioned, neither
to the class of purely good things nor things purely evil.
Hence the conclusion. The consequence has been noted and
the minor premise is presented in St. Bernard's letter to the
monk Adam [Migne‚ 182 : 96]‚ when he says: “Truly it must
be known that things intermediate often cease to be so. For

marriage may be lawfully contracted or not, but when once ⁸

contracted it cannot be dissolved. Therefore, what before
marriage is permitted to be a thing intermediate obtains,
when the parties are married, the force of a thing absolutely
good. Likewise, the possession of private property is for a
secular man a thing intermediate for he may or may not have
property, but for a monk, because he is not permitted to hold
property, it is a thing absolutely evil.” So much Bernard.
