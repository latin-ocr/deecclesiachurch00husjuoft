182 THE CHURCH

he died there remained three to contend for the papacy,
Pope John XXIII, Gregory in Sicily and Benedict in Spain.
But from what moving cause this diabolical strife originally
came, even the blind can discern, namely. from the dotation.
Hence, St. Jerome, in his Lives os tlze Fatlzers, wrote: “As
the church increased in possessions, she decreased in vir-
tues.” And what is set down as a probability by the Chron-
icles seems clear, as narrated by Castrensis, 4 : 86, who de-
scribes how, ‘at the time of the dotation of the church, an
angelic voice1 was heard in the air, saying, that day poison
was infused in the holy church of God. For, however it
came to be, this is true: either a good angel or a devil uttered
the voice, because it is certain that demons, who rejoice when
they do evil, are bound to serve God and to be messengers
of the truth, and it becomes God by the mammon of iniquity
to announce in advance to the people their danger.' From
these things the faithful are able to form a judgment whether
any one, by the mere fact that he is called pope, is indeed
the chief pontiff of the church and the most blessed father,

and in matters of the faith learned above all worshippers of
Christ, and whether he is the head of God’s holy church.

Rome and another at Avignon. The council of Pisa, 1409, attempted to bring
the schism to an end by the election of Peter Philargi, cardinal oi Milan, Alex-
ander V, who appears prominently in the history of Huss, He lived only a year
aster his election, and was followed by John XXIII, who was deposed by the
council of Constance, 1415. After receiving the resignation of Gregory XII, of
the Roman line, and deposing Benedict XIII, the last of the Avignon popes,
the council, 1417, finally terminated the schism by the election of Martin V.

openliche in the ayer.” Castrensis quotes Jcrome’s words as given by Huss,
and he adds that “when Constantine was baptized of Sylvester, he opened
the prisons, destroyed the temples of the idols, built new and restored old
churches, endowing them with spiritual privileges and immunities and assigned
one-tenth of all his possessions to the churches and, at the repairing of St.
Peter’s, turned the first spade of earth and carried ten baskets full of earth
on his shoulders,’' etc.
