who, dying for the law of Christ, finaHy overcome that beast.
For to these very ones the Saviour said, “Fear not them
which kill the body‚'' Matt. 10 ε 28, and “In the world ye
shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have over-
come the world‚'' John 16 : 33. Here Augustine, in his
Com. on John [Nic. Fathers, 7 ε 393], says: “In whom do
they have good cheer and overcome except in Him? For
he would not have overcome the world if the world over-

Christ as the only way, truth and life. In his de sex Erroribus, M on., 1 : 240-
243, he also gave the subject elaborate treatment, quoting at length from the
canon law and declaring that prelates guilty of it are in mortal sin, and so their
acts inv-alid. He speaks there of the sale of baptisms‚ confirmations, chrism,
the marrriage blessing, the mass and sepulture. Laymen also were guilty of
it who abet or wink at the practise in their priests. He returned to this vice
