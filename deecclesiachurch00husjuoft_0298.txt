244' THE CHURCH

in the day thou eatest of it, thou shalt surely die‚'’ Gen.
2 ; 18. Here, then, three things are to be thought of—he
who gives the word of command, the command and the
condition of the person called upon to obey. He who com-
manded is God, who cannot err; the command is exceed-
ingly useful; and man it is who heard God himself com-
manding. To eat, therefore, of the tree of the knowledge .
of good and evil after the prohibitive command was given,
was an absolute evil. In accordance with this, let us sup-
pose that the prelate Peter command John, his inferior, to
collect strawberries and let it be thought that it is not pos-
sible for him who commands to err in this, and let it be thought
of how much value such a work is for the person called upon
to obey, and also that the man called upon to obey is dis-
posed to do such a work, as was Adam to do God’s command,
and it is evident that in all these three, the comparison is not
the same. For a prelate may err and the work commanded
is not so useful, and the man called upon to obey is not so
disposed to do that work, as was Adam to do the command
of God.

Therefore‚ Bernard says that a work which is inter-mediate
is one which in respect of mode, time, or person may be
either good or bad; and here that saint insists upon the cir-
cumstances from the side of him who gives the command,
from the side of the work, and from the side of him called
to obey. Therefore, when he says that it is a work which is
intermediate so far as the mode goes, he urges a due measure
of the exercise oi reason, in such a way that he who com-
mands does not depart from the divine counsels. For, if a
prolate should command Peter, a subject, a learned priest in
God's law, to seed sows on the Lord’s day and God for that
day should counsel him to do for Him a work of superero-
gation incompatible with that act of feeding‚ then Peter
the priest is bound to obey God who counsels rather than
the prelate who commands. This is clear, for in this case the
