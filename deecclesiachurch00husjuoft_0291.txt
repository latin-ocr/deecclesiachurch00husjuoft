OBEDIENCE TO THE CHURCH 237

be observed except in so far as it is caused by a divine com-
mand before exemplifying it.

And hence, it is, that no obedience made to a superior
profits for merit except in so far as it leans towards obedi-
ence of the counsels and commandments of the Lord Jesus
Christ. This is clear, for obedience to Christ, owed or per-
formed, is in and by itself a reason oi merit which increases
or diminishes with the degree oi obedience or disobedience.
Hence nothing is more religious than obedience unto God,
as the Decretum 8 ε 1, Sciendum [F riedberg, 1 ε 593], teaches‚
where is noted what Samuel, the prophet, says, I Sam. 15 : 22:
“To obey is better than sacrifice, ior rebellion is as the sin
of witchcraft and stubbornness as a crime.''l “Obedience
itself‚'' says the Decretum, “is a virtue that possesses the merit
oi saith, and any one who is without it, is convicted of
being an unbeliever‚ even though he seem to be of the faith-
ful. The flesh of others, it says, is slaughtered in the case
of sacrifices, but by obedience our own will is sacrificed.''
Here it appears, it is clearer than the light, that Samuel is
speaking about obedience due to God, for he said to Saul:
“Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord
hath rejected thee from being king, and Saul said unto Sam-
uel, ‘1 have sinned, because Ι have transgressed the com-
mandment of the Lord and thy words, for I ieared the people
and obeyed their voice,''' I Sam. 15 ε 23, 24. It is clear how
much prelates of the people blaspheme who on the ground
of Scripture and ecclesiastica] law traffic in such obedience
for themselves; secondly, from Augustine’s authority, which
the doctors quote for their side, Sermon 86, when he says:
“If thou wilt fast, make prayer night and day, if thou wilt
beg, or be in ashes, or if thou wilt do anything else but what
is commanded in the Lord's law, and thou seemest wise to
thyself and art not obedient to the Father [understand not
the corporal Father, but the spiritual FatherJ——thou hast
lost all the virtues. This is clear, because he who obeys
