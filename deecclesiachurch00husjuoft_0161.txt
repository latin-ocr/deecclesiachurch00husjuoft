 

POWER OF BINDING AND LOOSING 107

his sins he shall not at my bar be held bound any further.'
After this manner we should also understand that which
Christ said to all his apostles: ‘Whosesoever sins ye remit,
they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye re-
tain, they are retained.' Assuredly the sins of offenders will
be remitted or retained with the Lord which have been prop-
erly remitted or retained by his ministers‚ the priests—both of
which are truly and really done by them when done in accord
with the canonical rite; nevertheless‚ neither of these things
can priests do at their personal pleasure, but only for desert
—merito—and according to the rite as instituted.'’ Thus
much Richard.

From Augustine and from this declaration by Richard‚
it is plain that it does not follow: Christ said to Peter or
to any vicar of his: “Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth‚''
that is, in the church militant, “shall be loosed also in heaven‚''
that is, in the church triumphant—therefore, whatsoever thou
shalt wish to loose on earth shall be loosed also in heaven.
And it is evident that by this clause the bestowment falls on
every person that is truly penitent. And als0‚ in view of the
words, “Whatsoever thou shalt bind‚” the bestowment falls
upon the impenitent‚ for the loosing applies to every truly
penitent person, the binding to the impenitent. The same is
true of retaining and remitting.

Therefore‚ Christ's disciple ought to be on his guard
against the fallacy of antichrist‚ when the following course
of argument is pursued: Whatsoever Christ's vicar shall bind
upon earth shall be bound also in heaven, but this faithful
layman who does not wish to give money for his absolution,
him he binds on earth. Therefore‚ this layman is bound in
heaven. Likewise‚ whatsoever Christ's vicar shall loose on
earth shall be loosed also in heaven, but him who is not
contrite and yet is willing to give money, him he looses on
earth. Therefore‚ is he loosed also in heaven. The case is
similar if it be argued: Whatsoever Christ's vicar looses on
