THE CHURCH FOUNDED ΟΝ CHRIST 87

Master asking him, “Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more
than these?’' and then immediately committing to him his
sheep to feed, John 21 : 15. But here it should be noted
that the reasons for loving Christ are manifold. Some love
Christ more than others on the ground of his divinity, as
is believed to have been the case with John the Evangelist3
others because of his humanity, as is believed to have been
the case with Philip3 and others love Christ because of his
body which is the church, and so men love him for many
other reasons, for which, in the case of a certain saint, they
quote Ecclesiasticus 42: “No one has been found like unto
him in keeping the law of the Most High.’' Peter's pre-erni-
nence is manifest from his faith, humility, love, yea, and also
from his poverty and endurance. For he said to the man
asking an alms: “Silver and gold have I none, but such as
I have give I thee,'' Acts 3 : 6. And, because he heard from
the Master the words, “In your patience possess ye your
souls,'' Luke 21 : 19, it seems probable that, after his de-
nial of the Master, Peter stood for that very reason more
ready to endure martyrdom and especially for the reason
that, recognizing his weakness, he had fresh in his mind the
memory of his own frailty in denying his Master. And for
this reason he stooped in humility to others and was more
ready to suffer imprisonrnents, even unto death, for the Lord
whom he denied. Nor is it to be doubted that he bore with
an humble mind Herod’s prison in Jerusalem, the prison of
N Theophilus in Antioch, and Nero’s prison at Rome.
If he, who is called to be Peter’s vicar, follows in the

he rules. But, if he walks in the opposite paths, then he is
the legate of antichrist at variance with Peter and Jesus
Christ. Therefore, St. Bernard‚ de consideratione, IV,l writes
