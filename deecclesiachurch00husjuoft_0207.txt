THE CHURCH WITHoUT POPE 153

of Christ spurned. It is thus clear how weak the argumen-
tation is: namely, the Roman church obtained the primacy
not from the apostles, but from the Lord himself. For this
reason every Roman pontiff ought to have pre-eminence in
the matter of mundane glory and have secular rule, when,
in fact, it ought rather to follow from the Decretum that
the Roman pontiff is charged with serving the people not
by ruling for his own ends, or suspending the people, but
by praying efficiently for the people, as according to the
Decretum [Friedberg, 1:74] Paul did, Romans 1 : 8. He
says: “A prayer may be poured out for all to the Lord of
all the saints, and in these words Paul, most blessed, prom-
ised the Romans over his own signature, ‘God is my wit-
ness whom I serve in my spirit, in the Gospel of his Son, how
unceasingly Ι make mention of you always in my prayers,’''
From this decretal it is seen that Pope Anacletus did not
intend to affirm that he himself was to have civil rule over
all others or hold a primacy of government over all other
persons of the church militant. Because, in thus seeking
his own glory he would show most clearly the mark of anti-
christ. John 5 :41 sqq. Yea, even Boniface VIII, in his
bull Unam sanctam, did not dare expressly to affirm this, for
then he alone would have borne witness that he was the
most holy man and, in this case, the faithful as well as un-
believers might appositely object against him: “Thou bear-
est witness of thyself 3 thy witness is not true'' [John 5 ε 31].

Therefore, the Roman pontiffs have become involved in
this difficulty by reason of the dotation and exaltation de-
rived from Caesar, because, when the emperor asks them,
whether, in the matter of government, they excel all mortals
living, in power, primacy and dignity, they have to admit
it to be so, for otherwise, as they say, no one is under obli-
gation to believe that they are popes. But Peter and Paul
did not make any such statement about themselves, for they
did not have any power given them by Caesar. For this
