24 THE CHURCH

or by predestination to present righteousness only, as are all
such who at one time or another accept the grace of the re-
mission of sins but do not persevere unto the end.

And, further, it is evident that grace is twofold—namely‚
the grace of predestination ωηο eternal life, from which a
person foreordained cannot finally fall away. The other is
the grace related to present righteousness, which now is
present and now is absent, now comes and now goes. The
first kind of grace makes sons for the holy universal church
and makes a man infinitely more perfect than the second
kind, because it bestows an infinite good to be enjoyed forever.
But not so the second kind of grace. Again, the first makes
sons of an eternal heritage, while the second makes officials
acceptable to God only for time. Hence it seems probable
that just as Paul was at the same time a blasphemer accord-
ing to present unrighteousness and yet of holy mother church,
and, consequently, one of the faithful and in grace in virtue
of predestination ωηο eternal life-so Iscariot was at one and
the same time in grace according to present righteousness
and yet never of holy mother church by predestination unto
life eternal, for that predestination was wanting in his case.
And so Iscariot, howbeit he was an apostle and bishop elected
by Christ—“bishop'' being the name of an office—was never-
theless never a part of holy mother church. Even so Paul
was never a member of the devil‚ howbeit he committed some
acts which were like the acts of the church of the wicked.
Similar was the case of Peter, who, by the Lord's permission‚
fell into grave perjury, but in order that he might rise the
stronger3 for, as Augustine says: It is expedient that the
predestinate fall into sins of that sort.

From what has been said, it is evident that there is a
twofold separation from holy church. The first is perma-
nent [cannot be lost—indeperdibilis], and here belong the
reprobate who are separated from the church. The second
may be lost—deperdibilis-—and here belong heretics, who are
