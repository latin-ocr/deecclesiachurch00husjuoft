274 THE CHURCH

Then, in regard to the excommunication, by which the
wicked separate the good from themselves, this should be
said, that the wicked excommunicated Christ and the man
born blind, as appears in John 9 : 22, 34. This kind of ex-
communication may be distinguished also from its opposite,
which is communion in evil, of which it is said: “Have
no communion with the unfruitful works of darkness,’' Eph.
5 : 113 and, “He that giveth him greeting communes in his
evil works,'' II John 11; and, “What communication has a
saint with a dog?'' Ecclesiasticus 13, as if he had said, None!
Therefore, every one being in grace in respect to present
righteousness is excommunicated [out of communion with]
from the wicked. And this is that holy excommunication
by which the righteous is said to be excommunicate, that
is, placed outside of communication or participation with
wickedness. Hence, John says: “And I heard another voice
from heaven saying, Corne forth, my people‚ out of her, that
ye have no participation with her sins and that ye receive not
of her plagues, for her sins have reached even unto heaven‚'’
Rev. 18 ; 4, 5. Let us ask the Lord that He may vouch-
safe to preserve us in His communion and guard us against
unlawful communion.
there more clearly, for example, 3, which there reads: “The injury to neigh-
bors which might easily arise as a result of the excommunication as, for ex-
ample, the deprivation of wholesome teaching and sacraments, for he who
wrongly excommunicates sometimes is the cause of the perdition of many
through the withholding from the excommunicate teaching by which he would
be instructed most profitably in the law of Christ.'’ And the fifth there reads:
“That the neighbors may not sin by avoiding him, cursing him, and withhold-
ing from him the works of charity.’' Huss’s treatment of the subJect of ex-
communication in the de sex Erroribus is more clear and practical than his
treatment in this chapter. There he introduces many pertinent quotations
from the Fathers and especially from the Scripturas which are not given here,
as, for example, Num. 23 : 8: “How shall Ι curse whom God hath not cursed? '’
On the other hand, he leaves out there the distinction between the major and
minor excommunications and the prolonged explanations of communication

and excommunication. The cases of Balaam and Ananias Huss uses often, e. g.,
Mon., 1 : 362, 401.
