46 THE CHURCH

wedding-garment, by the wheat, the good seed, the good tree,
the wise virgins, and the sheep.

Reflecting upon these things, the faithful should be on
his guard against this conclusion: the reprobate are in God's
holy church, therefore they are a part of it. For it has al-
ready been said that it is one thing to be in the church and
another to be of the church or to be a part or member of the
church. For as it does not follow, because the chaff and the
tares are among the wheat or mixed up with the wheat,
therefore the chaff is the wheat, so the conclusion does not
follow in the above proposition. Similarly as it does not
follow that, because ordure or a sore is in the body of a man,
therefore it is a part of his body, so it does not follow that
because a reprobate is in Christ's mystical body of the church,
therefore he is a part of it. Again, the following conclusion
is not valid, namely: he is in grace according to righteous-
ness, therefore he is a member or a part of the holy catholic
church. But this is right reasoning, namely: a man is in the
grace of predestination, therefore he is a part or member of
holy church. And again this reasoning is not valid: Peter
is in sin, therefore he is not a part or member of the holy
church. But it is good reasoning to say that at that time
he was not in the church according to the grace of present
righteousness. Arguing of this kind will be understood by re-
flecting what it is to be in the church and what it is to be a
member or part of the church3 and that it is predestination
which makes one a member of the holy catholic church, which
predestination is the preparation of grace in the present
time and of glory in the future. No place of dignity, no
human election, and no other outward sign makes one a
member of the church. For the devil Iscariot, who did not
refuse Christ's election and the temporal charisms given
unto him by virtue of his apostolate and episcopate—even
though the people believed that he was one of Christ's true
disciples—-was not a true disciple of Christ, but a wolf clad
