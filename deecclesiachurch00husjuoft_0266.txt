2 1 2 THE CHURCH

For as by one hinge only one door is ruled, so it would
be a good thing if by their doctrine and authority they were
ruled well themselves, so that afterwards other churches should
be well ruled. For in what manner do they rule our church
os Prague except by distributing benefices to the covetous and
collecting monies? But what has become of teaching and
the other ministrations of power?

Thirdly, the seat is conceived of as power, and in this way
it is conceived in Dist. Inferior. [21 14, Friedberg, 1 : 7o],
where Pope Nicolas says, “an inferior seat is not com-
petent to absolve a superior‚’' and he draws the conclusion
but unfittingly enough from Isaiah 10: 15, “Shall the axe
boast itself against him that heweth? Shall the saw mag-
nify itself against him that wieldeth it?'' when he says:
“Seeing these things are set forth in divine Scripture‚ we
have shown more clearly than the sun that no one who is
of lesser authority is competent to condemn by his judg-
ments one who is of greater power, or subject him by defini-
tions of his own.'' See how he here calls the inferior seat
the man of lesser authority and the superior seat the man
of greater authority. But how is the seat to be understood?
This Pelagius [a mistake for Gelasius] answers, when he says:
Dist. 21 [Friedberg, 1 : 7o]: “The first seat of the apostle
Peter is the Roman church, which has neither spot nor
wrinkle nor any such thing.'' See how the seat of Peter
is here called the Roman church. But by this is it verified,
that it is “without spot and wrinkle''? Since neither is the
pope that seat nor that church, nor is the pope in conjunc-
tion with the cardinals, for they are not “without spot.''
Nor is that seat the stone church. Of a truth, I am not able
otherwise to think of that seat except as it is all those who
imitate the life of Peter, measured finally by the law of
Christ. For these will be “without spot and wrinkle'' in
the heavenly country. But whether this is the meaning of
that pope or not, I do not know.
