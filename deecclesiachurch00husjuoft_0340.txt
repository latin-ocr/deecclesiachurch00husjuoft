286 THE CHURCH

his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his
mouth: who when he was reviled, reviled not again, and
when he suffered, threatened not‚’' I Peter 2 : 21—23. And
Paul traversing the same path, said: “Bless them that per-
secute you; bless and curse not,'' Romans 12 : 14. This
doctrine the other saints also followed, wh0, in the time of
persecution did not fulminate excommunication or suspen-
sion or impose the interdict, but when more serious persecu—
tion came, the more urgent were they in performing divine
ministries.

But after the thousand years, when Satan was loosed and
the clergy was fat with the refuse¹ of this world and lifted
up in pleasure, pride, and ease, the interdict had its origin.
For Pope Hadrian, who began to reign 1153, for a wound
which one cardinal had received, placed all Rome under the
interdict. Oh, how patient under trial was that pope—not,
indeed, as Christ, Peter, or Paul, or the apostle Andrew!
Later Alexander III also, who began to rule 1159, placed
the interdict on the kingdom of England,2 de Sponsalibus,
cap. 2, Non est vobis [F riedberg, 2 z 665]. Pope Celestine III,
who began to reign A. D. 1082, says something about the
interdict in chap. Quaesivit de majoritate et obedientia [Fried-
berg‚ 2 z 506]. Later Innocent III, who began to rule 1199
A. D., announced the interdict in many decretals, as in chap.
in concilio Lateranensi de praebendis, lib. 3 Decretalium [5 ε 28
sqq„ Friedberg‚ 2 : 478 sqq.]. Still later Boniface VIII, In-
nocent IV and Clement V imposed interdicts of this kind, in
the Liber Sextus and the Clementines [F riedberg, 2 z 937 sqq.].
And in this way many such interdicts have been multiplied,
while the clergy were inflamed with avarice, the pomp of this
world and restless ambition.

¹ The word used by the Vulgate, Phil. 3 : 8.

² Hadrian IV, the only English pope, one of whose cardinals was murdered
during the excitement caused by the presence and preaching of Arnold of

Brescia. Henry II of England was threatened with the interdict by Alexander
III, 1173, in case he did not deliver up to his sons their wives.
