OBEDIENCE To THE CHURCH 233

clear because to resign their kingdoms is for the one as for
the other not a thing absolutely evil, as is seen from the state-

that mandate or been absolved by Boniface, it follows that
they are still persisting in disobedience. But who of sound

He was then made papal inquisitor, with whom Huss had something to do, Doc„
