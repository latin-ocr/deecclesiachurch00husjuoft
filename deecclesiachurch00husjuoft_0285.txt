OBEDIENCE TO THE CHURCH 231

The maJ’or premise is proved in this way. No Roman
church is permitted to command, under pain of mortal sin,
that king, marquis, duke, baron, soldier, citizen or rustic
enter upon matrimony or that he may not hold private
property, therefore none of the persons mentioned are bound
to obey under pain of mortal sin. The consequence has been
noted and the antecedent is clear, because the Roman church
has no right to exalt its commandment above a counsel of
Christ. In commanding, however, that a king, marquis‚
duke, baron or soldier may not hold property, the Roman
church would exalt its commandment above Christ’s counsel,
for this is the first among the twelve chief evangelical coun-
sels, namely, voluntary poverty, which consists in the re-
nunciation of private property and is related to need. Christ
counseUed, he did not command, when he says to a certain
young ruler: “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that
thou hast and give to the poor and follow me,'’ Matt. 19 : 21.
Similarly, if the Roman church commands king, marquis,
duke or other secular person to enter upon marriage it
would be commanding contrary to a counsel of Christ and
would it, therefore, not be acting contrary to Christ? The
observance of virginal chastity until death is Christ's third
evangelical counsel, and of this he says: “There are eunuchs
that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's
sake,’' Matt. 19 : 12—because Christ does not command but
counsels that what is fitting for a person, that he ought with
good will to hold, and he says: “He that is able to receive
it, let him receive it.''

Therefore, it would be great presumption for the Roman
church to bind any one, under pain of mortal sin, above what
the counsels of his Lord demand. This would be to lay un-
bearable burdens on men's shoulders, as said the Saviour:
The things which the scribes and Pharisees, sitting in Moses’
seat, do not keep they lay upon others. Hence, Christ's
apossse, who saw the secret things of God, which the Roman
