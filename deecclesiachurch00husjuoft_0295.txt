CHAPTER XXI

CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH OBEDIENCE IS TO
BE RENDERED TO PRELATES

Now as to the authorities which the doctors have ad-
duced to emphasize the necessity of human obedience‚ the
following is briefly to be said. For, in the first place, they
say: “The Roman church and prelates are to be obeyed
by inferiors in all things, according to the Saviour's state-
ment, ‘All things whatsoever they bid you, these do and
observe,'’' Matt. 23 : 2.1 Here I wonder why the doctors
openly cut off the Saviour's previous words, for they do not
quote: “The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.’'
Nor did they add the later words, “Do not ye according
to their works‚’' but they only quote the intervening words:
“All things whatsoever they bid you, these do and observe.’'
Here it seems to me that they have so done because the
pope and other prelates of the church do not wish to be
compared with scribes and Pharisees, and if anything is
said of their evil works they are indignant3 and because also
the doctors and masters are flattered by such thingS, and
so the former heap up to themselves masters having itching
ears who turn away from the truth and the masters are
flattered. Therefore, the apostle's prophecy is fulfilled in
both particulars, for he adjures Timothy saying: “I charge
thee in the sight oi God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge
the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his king-
dom: preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season;
