 

OBEDIENCE TO PRELATES 245

superior is more to be reverenced, one whom every subject is
more bound to obey; and the enjoined act also is more use-
ful. But the act enjoined by the prelato, namely to seed
sows on the Lord’s day, is in respect to merit a thing indif-
ferent, but the act enjoined by God has of and in itseli the
reason of merit.

Hence, I could wish that he might reply to St. Bernard
in respect to this case. If St. Benedict had bid him seed
sows for himself and, for the same time, God had given him
a counsel to give advice to persons asking in the church with
respect to the salvation oi their souls‚ Ι am of the opinion
that the authority of him who counsels and the greater use-
fulness of the counsel, as compared with the commands of
St. Benedict‚ would have forced Bernard to hearken rather
to the divine counsel than to Benedict’s command, both to
the honor of God and to the salvation ol those asking coun-
sel. From this it is seen to follow, that we owe more to
any divine counsel whatever than to a human command
which is incompatible with it. Secondly‚ it is seen to fol-
low that no one is bound to obey a private command except
in so far as it admonishes in accordance with the divine counsel
or command; and it is clear that, as regards the mode, a due
measure of reason is involved and also the quality of the com-
mand, both of which he who is called upon to obey and he
who commands ought to consider. For what reason would
there be for the command of a dull and fat bishop that a
priest should seed sows and send away Christ’s sheep without
pasturing them—sheep which Christ purchased with his own
blood?

Similarly must the circumstance of place be thought of,
for, if a prelate should bid a subject to appear in a place
where enemies are who are planning the subject's death, the
subject is not bound to obey. Hence Pope Clement V, de
Sent. et rejud. in Clement. [Friedberg‚ 2 ε 1152], says: “Who
would dare or by what reason would any one be held bound
