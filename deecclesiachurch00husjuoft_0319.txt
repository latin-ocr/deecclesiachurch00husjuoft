 

EXCOMMUNICATIONS, JUST AND UNJUST 265

the statement: processes to the contrary import‚ if received,
would have to be obeyed—does not contradict this, when
the conclusion is added: “Nor is it the business of the clergy
in Prague to pronounce sentence whether the excommunica-
tion of Master John Huss is just or unjust.'' For if those
processes are to be obeyed with respect to excommunication‚
then they are to be obeyed by them as just and not as un-
just. Because the clergy together with the doctors obeys
them and received them, therefore it obeys them as just
and received them as just, and consequently the doctors to-
gether with the clergy passed upon them sentence that they
are just. Nevertheless, their conclusion says that it is not
for the clergy in Prague to pass sentence whether the ex-
communication of Master John Huss is just or unjust. And
an evident contradiction is established, namely, the clergy
in Prague eries out, affirms and asserts that the excommuni-
cation of Master John Huss is just, therefore the clergy in
Prague passes the sentence that that excommunication is
just; yet the conclusion of the doctors says that it is not
for the clergy in Prague to pass sentence whether that judg-
ment of excommunication is just or unjust, It is most clear
that this conclusion contradicts the facts and the sentence
of the clergy of Prague.

Likewise‚ if it is not for the clergy in Prague to pass
sentence whether that excommunication is just or unjust,
and the clergy approves the processes and acts in accordance
with the processes; therefore the clergy in Prague does not
know whether it is acting justly or unjustly, nor does it hope
that it is acting justly. For hope ought to go before the
sentence.

Likewise‚ these doctors themselves pass the sentence that
the excommunication of Master John Huss is just, and this is
clear because they pass the sentence that the processes are to
be obeyed, and not as though they were unJust; hence, as
though they were just. Consequently, the-,doctors pronounce
