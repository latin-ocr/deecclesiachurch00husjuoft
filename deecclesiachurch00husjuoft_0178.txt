1 24 THE CHURCH

Wishing to put an end to this pride, the African council,¹
Dist. 99 [F riedberg, 1 ε 350], says: “Let not the bishop of
the first see be called the prince of priests or high priest or
anything of this kind, but only bishop of the first see. And
the Roman pontiff is not to be called universal bishop.''
Proscribed are all these things which proceed from ostenta-
tions, pride, flattery, avarice, and from the blind deception
of the unlearned. Returning, therefore, to our most lowly
High Priest, Jesus Christ, who bade him that was called to
the wedding take the lowest place [Luke 14 : 9], let us con-
fess to him according to his precept that we are unprofitable
servants, Luke 17 : 10. For he said: “When ye shall have
done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are
unprofitable servants.” For, when we have kept all his pre-
cepts, and shall have humbled our souls before this High
Priest——knowing that it is possible that our pontiffs may be
thieves and robbers—this Bishop of our souls will not fail
us in things necessary to salvation‚ but will pasture, guard,
and feed his sheep as a truly good Shepherd.

and the canon of the N. T. as then accepted by all Western Christendom.
