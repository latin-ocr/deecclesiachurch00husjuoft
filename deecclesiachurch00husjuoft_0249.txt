THE APOSTOLIC SEE, OR CATHEDRA PETRI

Now that certain statements have been made about
obedience‚ I want to return to the statement of the doc-
tots, in which it appears that “obedience is to be rendered
by inieriors to the apostolic seel of the Roman church, and
to the prelates in all things whatsoever, where that which
is purely good is not forbidden and that which is not purely
evil is commanded, but also in that which is intermediate,''
etc.

And here consideration must be had of the apostolic see,
about which many, and especially the canonists‚ predicate
many things, who, nevertheless, are ignorant what the apos-
tolic see is. For some think that it really is a seat of wood
or stone in which the pope is wont to sit bodily. Others
think that it is the Roman curia; others that it is the seat
of St. Peter, in which he sat bodily; others that it is Rome3
others that it is the pope's power; others still that it is the
church or basilica of St. Peter. But it is to be noted that
apostolic is derived from apostle, and apostle means one sent
from God. The Saviour, whom God sent, said, John 3 : 34:
“I speak the words of God.'' Hence, he also said to his dis-
ciples that “as the Father sent me, so also send 1 you,'' John
20 z 21-namely, to bear testimony to the truth, to preach
the word of salvation, and, by life and teaching‚ to show
the way of blessedness to the people.

Hence, every priest who is not seeking his own glory but

¹ The word “see” comes from sedes, a seat, and was interchangeable with
the Greek word thronos, seat, and Latin cathedra, chair.
