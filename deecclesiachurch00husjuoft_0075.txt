ALL CHRISTIANS ARE NOT MEMBERS 21

flowing into them from the soul, from which these forces be-
come part of the very essence 01 the members; neverthe-
less, the inflowing comes first, and the operation 01 the
members is voluntary and gracious and meritorious.l
Further‚ it is to be noted that, as there is in the human
body an element which is not 01 the body itself, as spittle,
phlegm, ordure,² and fluid or urine, and this element is not
of the body because it is not a part 01 the body—and it is an-
other thing to be a part 01 the human body, as is every one 01
its members-so also there is something in the mystical body
01 Christ, which is the church, that is nevertheless not 01 the
church, since it is not a part 01 it3 and in this way every
reprobate Christian is 01 the body just as ordure is 01 the body
and to be finally separated from it. And so it is one thing to
be 01 the church and another thing to be in the church—aliud
esse de ecclesia, aliud esse in ecclesia. And it is clear that it does
not follow 01 311 pilgrims who are in the church, that they
are then oi the church, but the opposite. For we know that
the tares grow together with the wheat, the raven feeds on
the same threshing-floor as the dove, and the chaff is gathered
into the same garner with the grain. Nevertheless‚ there is
an incommunicable distinction between them, just as has
been illustrated by the human body. In this way we ought
to think 01 holy mother church, and to these things I John
2 ι 18 has reference where it is said: “Now have there arisen
many antichrists. They went out from us, but were not 01 us;
for, 11 they had been 01 us, they would have continued with us.’'
For just as superfluity proceeds from food and the solid mern-
bers and yet is not 01 them, so the purgaments 01 the church,
namely the reprobate, proceed from her and yet are not 01 1101·
35 parts; 101· 110110 01 her parts can 1311 away from her finally,
because predestinating love, which binds her together, does
not fail. This the apostle asserts, I Cor. 13, and this he
