294 THE CHURCH

cording to the method practised by the Roman curia, are
subject to the curia’s command, for every human creature
is subject to the Roman pontiff, so it is said in the Extrava-
gante of Boniface VIII [the bull Unam sanctamL namely:
“Further we declare, say and define that it is altogether
necessary for salvation for every human creature to be sub-
ject to the Roman pontiff.'’ Similarly, the angelic world is
subject to the Roman pontiff, as appears in the bull of Pope
Clement: “We command the angels of paradise that they
lead to the glory of paradise the soul of hjm who has been
wholly absolved from purgatory.'’

Since, therefore, according to this method of the curia,
every rational creature—angel and man—is subject to the
commands of the Roman pontiff, and since the method in the
processes of the same curia states that “whatsoever place,
privileged or unprivileged, to which John Huss shall g0, and
as long as he may be there, we do subject them to the ecclesi-
astical interdict''—it follows that if, by the highest possibility,
John Huss, according to God's absolute power, reached by
death the heavenly Jerusalem, that city would be subject
to the ecclesiastical interdict. But blessed be God Almighty,
who has ordered that the angels and all the saints in that heav-
enly Jerusalem are not subject to an interdict of this sort!
Blessed also be Christ, the chief Roman pontiff, who has
given grace to his faithful ones that, when there is no Roman
pontiff for a given time, they may, under Christ as their
leader, arrive in the heavenly country! For who would say
that while the woman Agnes, to all appearances, was for
two years and five months the only pope, no one then could
be saved? Or again, who would say that after a pope’s death
and in the interval between the pope's death and the elec-
tion of his successor, no man dying in that period could be
saved? Blessed also be God Almighty, who ordains that His
militant church shall have such life that, when a pope is
dead, she is not on that account without a head or dead!
