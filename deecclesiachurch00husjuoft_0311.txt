OBEDIENCE To PRELATES 257

would be resisting the pope. Then we should grant that
Paul is obedient and Peter also, because before they resisted
one another they were both obedient, and Peter by resisting,
was not disobedient but, as follows from what has been said,
his obedience is confirmed. And it is not valid to deny the
pertinency of this case on account of the following things,
namely, (1) because only what was neutral or possible was
commanded and (2) because a prelate may command what
in itself is impossible and altogether unreasonable‚ therefore,
he may command that thing, and so there remains no reply
except the truth that neither more nor less on account of
his commanding do the cleric and the layman incur reward
or penalty. For a command must be reasonable with God
if it is to be obeyed. And then it would hold good, pro-
vided no one under human authority would make that
command, since otherwise a man would become disobedient
to reason. And it is clear that, as in the case supposed,
there would be no possibility left of looking for remission
or anathema, so in a general way there would not be in
the case of a papal sentence except so far as one merited
thern in accordance with God's will. This logical objection
must be solved. And similarly suppose, that Peter the prior
had‘ a second Twelve made up of conventuals all obedient
to him, and he should bid the more stable Twelve not to
speak with the other unless perchance by being disobedient
it might bring the other to obedience. And it is clear that
the second Twelve did not talk with the rest except, by
obeying Peter, to bring the other to obedience, and Paul of
the former Twelve should speak with Linus of the latter
Twelve both of them excelling in this that they have regard
to the injunction of obedience, so that, before the talking
occurred, both were lawfully obedient to Peter; and the
contradiction will appear.¹
