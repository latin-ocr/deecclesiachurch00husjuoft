in which men, wise and icaring the Lord‚ ought to sit, rnen
in whom is the truth and who hate covetousness. For so
Ex, 18: 15 has it: “And Moses said to hjs father-in-law‚
Jethro, The people come unto me seeking the sentence of
God‚ and when any act of false dealing has occurred they
come unto me that I may judge between thern and show

And Jethro said to Moses: “Provide out of all the people
able men who sear God‚ in whom is the truth and who hate

and men ‘ who hate covetousness‚’ because covetous men are
easily turned away from righteousness by gifts.'’ So much

in Moses' cathedra. Therefore all things whatsoever they
bid you, these do and observe‚ but do not ye after their
works, for they say and do n0t‚” Matt. 23 : 2, 3. Here cer-

“they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay
them on men’s shoulders.'' Certainly unreasonable doctrine
and unrighteousness are here referred to. “But they them-
selves will not move them with their finger.'' Certainly
an easy-going life! “All their works they do to be seen
