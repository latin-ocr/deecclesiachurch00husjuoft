xxxviii INTRODUCTION

F ather, art in me and I in thee‚'' so much quoted in this
present age as if corporate union were the test of the ful-
filment of the words. Huss's treatise presents an entirely
different test of Christian unity. He must not be pressed too
far. N evertheless, it is plain that he laid stress on particu-
lar churches¹ and made the bond of union between them
and between their members predestinating grace and an
active life of Christian virtue.

VI. THE CANON LAW. The authorities used in this
treatise are the Scriptures‚ accredited writers of the church,
the canon law and Wyclif. Among the accredited writers
frequently quoted are Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory
the Great, Bernard, and Peter the Lombard. It is notice-
able that Bonaventura’s name is not mentioned at all, whereas
Wyclif's Treatise on the Church quotes him at least sixteen
times, and, for some reason, Huss draws upon Thomas
Aquinas much less than did his English precursor.

With few exceptions the places where these quotations
are found in the volumes of Migne and the Nicene Fatlzers
series have been noted, and also the references to the canon
law as they are found in F riedberg's edition.2 The verses
of the Scripture texts, which in Huss's time had not yet been
marked, have been supplied. All this matter, which the
translator is responsible for, is enclosed in brackets, as also
an occasional brief explanation.

Like the sacramental system, the universities and the
cathedrals, the body of the canon law was one of the im-
posing constructions of the Middle Ages. It had as its first
and chief compiler Gratian who, about 1150, was teaching
church law in Bologna as Imerius was teaching Roman law.

¹ The XXXIX Articles of Religion speak of “every particular or national
church’' as having authority, etc.

² A. Friedberg, Corpus juris canonici, 1879—1881, 2 vols., pp. 1468, 1340, is
pronounced by the Catholic canonica! writer, P. Hergenrother‚ Lehrhuch d. kath.
K .-rechts‚ p. 192, “ the best edition.'’ A description of the canon law will be found
in Friedberg's Introd. to vol. I and in Hergenrother, pp. 172-106. For a history
of the subject of the treatment, see the elaborate work of J. F. von Schulte,
