18 THE CHURCH

his body and that every one who is predestinate is one of her
members and consequently a part of this church‚ which is
Christ's mystical body, that is, hidden body, ruled by the
power and influence of Christ, the Head, and compacted and
welded together by the bond of predestination. This under-
lying proposition follows from that saying of the apostle:
“He gave him to be head over all the church which is his
body,'' Eph. 1 ε 22. It also follows from the words when,
speaking as the representative of the predestinate‚ he says:
“We being many are one body in Christ‚'' Romans 12 : 5. It
also follows from Eph. 4 : 1 1, 15: “He gave some apostles, some
prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers‚
for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry
unto the edifying of the body of Christ‚'’ And further on
it is said: “Doing the truth in love, let us grow up in all things
into him who is the head, even Christ, for whom all the body
compacted together by that which every joint supplieth,
according to the working in the measure of each several part,
maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in
love.''

Further it is to be noted that Christ is called the head of
the church for the reason that he is the most exalted individual
of the human family, imparting to all its members motion
and feeling. For as in a man the most excellent part is the
head, which gives to the body and to its parts motion and
feeling, and without which neither the body nor any of its
members could live the life of nature, so Christ is the in-
dividual, the true God and man, imparting spiritual life and
motion to the church and every one of its members and
without whose influence it could not live or feel. And as
in a man’s head are all the senses, so in Christ are hid all the
treasures of the wisdom and knowledge of God. Col. 2 ε 3.
The above judgment is also involved in the apostle's words
when he says, Col. 1 : 20: “All things were created by him
and in him; and he is before all, and in him do all things consist
