108 THE CHURCH

earth shall be loosed also in heaven, but him, who is evi-
dently a reprobate, he looses on earth in the agony of death,
therefore he is loosed also in heaven. In these arguments
the minor premise is wanting in strength; for unless the said
man, in the case of the minor premise, binds himself by a
bad will or looses himself by true contrition‚ the minor prem-
ise is false. And, according to Richard, the argument is
to be rectified in this way: “Whatsoever Christ's vicar shall
properly bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven. But
this faithful layman who does not wish to give money, him
he binds properly on earth.⁷' Thus the falsehood of the
minor premise is made to appear. In a similar way the
other arguments are to be corrected. And, if the objection
be raised that a Christian ought to be in doubt as to when
a priest binds and looses according to the rite and when not,
the reply is to be made that the opposite follows [we should
not be in doubt]‚ since we ought to believe that the priest
binds and absolves only in cases when he ministers according
to the rules of Christ’s law. And when he exceeds that law,
then he alleges that he is binding and loosing, but does not
bind and loose.

Then as to Innocent’s words: “The Lord made no ex-
ception when he said to Peter: ‘Whatsoever,' etc.'' If Inno-
cent understands a bestowment in any case whatsoever, when
Peter or his vicar might allege they were binding, then Inno-
cent's meaning would be false. For then, through a subordi-
nate assumption, an improper conclusion would follow, the
argument running thus: whatsoever Peter or his vicar shall
bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven. But this holy man
he alleges he is binding on earth: therefore he is bound in
heaven. The conclusion is false and impossible. The minor
proposition is true or may be true. Therefore the application
of Innocent’s major proposition would be false. But, if Inno-
cent means with Richard, Augustine, and Gregory that the
bestowment is for that for which binding and loosing are in-
