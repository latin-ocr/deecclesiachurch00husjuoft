ALL CHRISTIANS ARE NOT MEMBERS 19

and he is the head of the body, the church who is the begin-
ning and the first born from the dead; that in all things he
might have the pre-eminence—primatum—for in him it was
pleasing that all fulness should dwell and through him to
reconcile all things to himself.''

This unity of the body—that is the church—the apostle
proves by showing, I Cor. 12 : 3, that the diversity of graces,
ministries and operations proceeds from the one spiritual Lord
who works in all. For grace must precede: it is the beginning
of ministration for clerics and of operation for laymen. The
Spirit gives grace, the Lord receives ministration, and God
demands ministration. “ To one,'’ the apostle says, “is given
by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of
knowledge by the same Spirit3 to one saith in the same Spirit,
to another the grace of healing. to another the working of mira-
cles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to
another divers sorts of tongues, to another the interpretation
os words.'' These nine the apostle seems to express one after
the other, each in its own logical order in the men who
receive the gif ts. God, he says, has placed some in the church,
first apostles‚ secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers‚ then
miracles, then gif ts of healings, interpretations of words, helps,
governments‚ divers sorts of tongues, all nine of which seem
to be correlated to the former nine. And in the same passage,
comparing the body of Christ and its members to the body
of the natural man, the apostle says, I Cor. 12 : 12: “As
the body is one and hath many members, but all the members
of the body, though they are many, are one body3 so also is
Christ.''

There is to be noted a threet'old correspondence and a
threefold difference between the members of the mystical
body and the human body. For as the members compose
one body to which the sou] is joined, and again as each member
is necessary to every other, the one helping the other in the
performance of its functions, so it is true of the members of
