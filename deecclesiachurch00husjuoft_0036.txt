xxx INTR'ODUCTION

We come now to the temper in which the two works are
written as indicatedby particular statements as well as the
general drift. Huss is much less severe in his judgrnents of
individuals than is Wyclif. The latter called Gregory XI a
terrible devil—horrendus diabolus—and blessed God for
bringing him to his death when He did. The cardinals he
stigmatized as the very synagogue and nest of Satan and a
nest of heretics.1

At times, in his English writings‚ he calls the pope the
vicar of the fiend—the devil. Huss joins with Wyclif in
saying that it might be well to get along without a pope,
though not in such strong language, but nowhere uses such
an expression as Wyclif's‚ enormous pride of the Western
church—monstruosa superbia ecclesiae occidentalis—or plainly
denounces the last clause of Boniface's bull as to be detested.²
Nor did Huss in his treatise directly repudiate the authority
oi church teachers such as Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventura‚
as Wyclif did, although, as his pages show, he put strange in-
terpretations on some of the statements oi the canon law and
seems to have been at times under the constraint of usage
in clinging to those statements rather than of conviction.

Huss, in other words, was much less severe in his J'udg-
ment of individuals and more moderate in his language than
his predecessor. Wyclif used a sharp blade and sometimes
the acrimony of the pamphleteer. The Bohemian carried
to his desk the homiletic instinct oi the preacher addressing
an audience whose welfare he held in mind. The one was
governed somewhat by the love oi the truth as a matter of
intellectual determination3 the other altogether by the love
of the truth as a practical force in daily life.

In his last months in prison, Huss definitely accepted the
distribution of the cup to the laity and exclaimed against
the impiety of the council’s act when it threatened every
priest with the ban who dared to distribute it. On the other
