INTRODUCTION xix

James presided as a superior over the conclave at Jerusalem
and Paul required no human license—sine licentia—to preach
and to rule.

Not only all bishops but all presbyters are successors of
the Apostles, as originally the church was governed by pres-
byters. For this view Huss quoted Jerome's famous state-
ment.¹

It must be remembered that in the Middle Ages the
episcopate was not looked upon as a distinct order. The
three orders, according to Thomas Aquinas, were the sub-
deacon‚ deacon and priest.

The keys were conferred upon the church‚ Matt. 18 ε 17,
18, and in binding and loosing, Peter acted as a representa-
tive of the church. The church is the final tribunal. In
giving the power to Peter, Christ gave it in his person to
every presbyter whatsoever.2

Priestly acts of all kinds are invalid except as the priest's
life is conformed to Christ's law.³ No one has ever more
clearly laid stress on the necessity of purity of life to the
clerical office than Huss.

The power of the keys, or of remitting sins and retaining
them, is a declaratory power such as the priest under the old
dispensation exercised in pronouncing the leper clean and as
the disciples exercised in loosing Lazarus, John 11 ε 44. The
priest did not make the leper clean nor did the disciples re-
lease Lazarus from the bonds of death. Neither pope nor
priest can absolve from sin except where God has before
absolved. ‚As Huss said in his attack against John XXIII’s
huns, the pope’s act in absolving is nothing more than the
announcement of a herald—sactum papae ad maximum non est
nisi praeconis Dei promulgati0.4 Peter bade Simon Magus
