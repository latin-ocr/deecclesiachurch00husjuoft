222 THE CHURCH

which St. Bernard calls divine counsels. For Peter says:
“We must obey God rather than men,'' Acts 5 ε 29. Hence,
as we are commanded to obey our superiors in things lawful
and honorable, with the circumstances taken into considera-
tion, so we are commanded to resist them to the face when
they walk contrary to the divine counsels or commandments.
For Paul, teaching that we should be his imitators‚ I Cor.
4 z 16, withstood Peter to the face for a light offence, Gal.
2 : 11. But much more are we bound to obey Paul and
every writer oi divine Scripture rather than the Roman pon-
tiff, when it comes to matters indifferent or neutral. And
as we are not bound to follow any apostle, except in so far
as he follows Jesus Christ, so it is evident by the limitation
laid down by the apostle that we are bound to obey no prel-
ate who has lived since the apostles, except as he commands
or counsels Christ's counsels or commands. And so the holy
apostle, I Cor. 4, 11, when he counsels that they be his imi-
tators immediately announces the manner of such imitation,
when he says, “even as Ι also am a follower oi Christ.'’
Therefore, the wise inferior ought to examine into the com-
mands of a superior when he seems to deviate from Christ's
law, or his rule. For no superior is above correction. Hence,
Christ often commanded us to be watchful in our works:
“I say unto you all, watch,’' Mark 13 : 36. And the apostle
said: “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the
spirits whether they be oi God, for many false prophets are
gone out into the world,’' I John 4 : 1. The Saviour also
said: “Many salse prophets shall arisel and lead many
astray,’' Matt. 24 ε 5.

And in this connection, St. Bernard speaks very finely in
his Letter to Adam the Monk [Migne, 182 : 100 sq.],² when
he rebukes him because he had unwisely obeyed his abbot

¹Surgent,· Vulgate has venient.
² Adam, monk of Morimond, a Cistercian abbey in the diocese of Langres,

whose abbot was Arnold. The letter is dated, in Migne, 112 5.
