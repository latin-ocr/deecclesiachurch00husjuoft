216 THE CHURCH

by a possibility Rome, like Sodom, were destroyed, the Chris-
tian church would be still standing. And it is not true that,
wherever the pope is, there is Rome. Howbeit, it is true
that, wherever the pope shall be so long as he is here on
the earth, there Peterâ€™s authority abides with the pope, so
long as the pope does not depart from the law of our Lord
Jesus Christ. So much I have wanted to say about the
apostolic seat for the present.
