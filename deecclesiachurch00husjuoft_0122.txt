68 THE CHURCH

about himself and refusing to believe what he did not wish
to be believed about himself, he believes every article, af-
firmative or negative, which is to be believed about Christ.
This saith Peter had implicitly when he expressly consessed
Christ to be true God and true man, saying: “Thou art Christ,
the Son of the living God.'’ And yet the same Peter explicitly
set himself against Christ and his Gospel when, after Christ
had said, “All ye shall be offended in me this night’' [Matt.
26 z 31], he denied and said: “Though all be offended in thee,
yet will I never be offended.” Thus also many of the faith-
ful in common [that is, as a body] believe implicitly all the
truth of Scriptum, and when a truth unknown to them is
proposed, they search to see if it is laid down in holy Scripture,
and if this is shown to be the case they at once acknowledge
the sense which the Holy Spirit insists on. Therefore, whoever
has in common with others saith formed in love, this suffices
sor salvation when accompanied with the grace of persever-
ance. For God, who gave the first faith‚ will give to his soldier
clearer faith‚ unless he puts some hindrance in the way. For
God does not demand of all his children that they should con-
tinuously during their sojourn here be in the particular act
of thought about any particular point of saith, but it is enough
that, putting aside inertia and callousness, they have saith
formed as a habit.

F aith, therefore, we must understand, is twofold: the one
unformed, which is exercised by the demons who believe and
tremble; the other saith formed in love. The latter, accom-
panied with perseverance, saves, but not the former. Hence
with reference to the saith formed in love the words were
spoken: “Whosoever believeth in the Son of God, hath
eterna] life‚'’ John 3 ε 15. And the Saviour said to Peter,
who had that faith and professed it: “Blessed art thou, Simon
Bar—Jonah.'' This saith is the foundationl os the other virtues

from the word substantia, used in the Vulgate, Heb. 11 z 1 (hupostasis), sub-
