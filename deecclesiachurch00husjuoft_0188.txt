134 THE CHURCH

teach the people whether for the whole clergy that lived at
that time and held Agnes to be a true pope, Agnes was really
the head of the church; or, if the church was at that time
without a head-acephalous1—with only a nominal pope in
the church militant for two years and five months, the faith-
ful for that reason ought not to think that it is not of the
substance of the catholic saith to believe expressly [beyond
a doubt] that Liberius, Joanna, Boniface, Clement‚ or Urban
were predestinate or members of holy mother church—in
view of the judgment given above.

In the same way, it is not of necessity to salvation for
all Christians, living together, that they should believe ex-
pressly that any one is head of any church whatsoever unless
his evangelical life and works plainly moved them to believe
this. For it would be all too much presumption to affirm
that we are heads of any particular church which perhaps
might be a part of holy mother church. How, therefore, may
any one of us without revelation presume to assert of himself
or of another that he is the head, since it is said truly, Ecclesi-
asticus 9, that “no one knows, so far as predestination goes,
whether one is worthy of love or hatred.’'

Likewise, if we examine in the light of the feeling and
influence with which we influence inferiors and, on the other
hand, examine by the mirror of Scripture, according to which
we should regulate our whole lise, then we would choose
rather to be called servants and ministers of the church than
its heads. For it is certain that if we do not fulfil the office
of a head, we are not heads, as Augustine, de decem chordis
[Migne’s ed., 38 : 75-91]‚ says: that a perverse husband is
not the head of his wife, much less is a prelate of the church,
who alone from God could have a dignity of this kind, the
head of a particular church in case he fall away from Christ.²

¹ Huss uses the same Greek word a number of times as in his Replies to

Palecz and Stanislaus‚ Mon.¹ 1 ε 320, 347.

² Not an exact quotation. The inserence is drawn by Huss. The Sermon on
the Ten Strings, Psalms 144 : 9, has much to say on the relation of husband
and wife on the basis oi “Thou shalt not commit adultery.'’
