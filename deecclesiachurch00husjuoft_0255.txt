THE APOSTOLIC SEE 201

In the cathedra, however, that is, in the authority and
in the teaching of the laW, he verily sits who teaches the
law and keeps the commandments of the law. Hence Au-
gustine says on Psalm 1 : 3: “‘And his delight is in the law
of the Lord.' It is one thing to be in the law and another
to be under the law; he who is in the law acts and does
according to the law3 he who is under the law is acted upon
according to the laW.'’ See how clear the exposition of this
holy man is. Whoso, therefore, “does and teaches‚ he shall
be great in the kingdom of heaven‚'' says the Saviour, Matt.
5 : 19. Truly, therefore, he sits in the cathedra of Moses
or Peter who lives well and teaches well in the authority
of Scripture, who adds nothing extraneous to the law, nor
seeks gain or profit from the cathedra.

On the other hand, he sits ill in the cathedra who either
teachoe ssl or lives ill, or who teaches good things and lives
ill, or who neither teaches good things nor lives well. And
such, alas, are many who seek the things that are their own
and not the things of Jesus Christ. Of these our Saviour
said: “The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses’ cathedra, for
they say and do not.'’ And a little later he says: “Woe
unto you scribes and Pharisees, who shut up the kingdom
of heaven against men, for ye enter not in yourselves, neither
suffer ye them that are entering in to enter,'⁷ Matt. 23 : 13.

And see the other part. “Ye have made void the com-
mandment of God because of your tradition. Ye hypocrites,
well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, This people hon-
oreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. But
in vain do they worship me, teaching the doctrines and com-
mandments of men,’' Matt. 15 ε 6. They, therefore, sit ill
in the cathedra of Moses and Peter, or of Christ, who teach
good things and do them not. Worse are those who neither
teach nor do. Worst are those who prevent the teaching of
good things. And still worst of all are they who live ill,
forbid the teaching of good things and teach their own things.
