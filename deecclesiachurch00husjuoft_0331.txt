 

SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT 277

ministers suspends by the natural order of things any oflend-
ing prelate from his office and ministry when he is actually
in criminal offence. For he sins by the very fact that he
falls into mortal sin, whatever it be that he may do, and
consequently he is forbidden of God to sin in that way, and
consequently he is suspended by God from that office. Hence,
the prophet says: “God said unto the sinner, What hast
thou to do, to declare my statutes, and that thou hast taken
my covenant in thy mouth? seeing thou hatest instruction
and castest my words behind thee. When thou sawest a thief
thou rannest with him, and hast been a partaker with adul-
terers. Thy mouth abounds in evil and thy tongue blabbeth
deceit. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother and
thou settest up slander against thy mother’s son,'' Psalm
50 : 16—20. Here God enumerates the sins for which He sus-
pends the sinner from the publication of His covenant which
is the law of truth. The first sin is disobedience to God,
the second, rejection of His words; the third, theft; the fourth,
adultery; the fifth, wickedness of mouth, which divides itself
into lies, blasphemy, false testimony, deceit, slander, vain
speaking, malediction, base speaking, and such like ; the sixth,
the sin of taking offence at Christ.

From this we gather how rare are judges, preachers and
others who publish God's covenant to the people who should
not be suspended of God from the publication of that cove-
nant. Therefore, let the faithful note in the matter of sus-
pension just spoken of from the office of publishing God’s
covenant and for the threefold example spoken of above
whether or not our prelates and clerics are suspended of
God. First, if they thrust from themselves the knowledge
of Scriptures and the task of evangelization‚ then are they
suspended by God, as in the lesser case [that is, preaching
under the Ο. Τ.] we read in Hosea 4, for our prelates have,
on the one hand and the other, greater material for preach-
ing and a better model and also certain reasons for preach-
