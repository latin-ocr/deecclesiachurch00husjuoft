THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH 9

de Pam„ Dist. 1 ε C. Eccl. [Friedberg 1 : 1179]: “The church
of Christ has no spot or wrinkle or anything of that sort,
but he who is a sinner or is soiled with any filth cannot be
said to be of Christ's church.'' This holy universal church
is Christ’s mystical body, as the apostle says, Eph. 1 : 22:
“He gave himself to be the head over all the church, which
is his body.'' Again he said, Col. 1 : 18, “He is the head of
the body, which is the church,'’ and again, Col. 1 : 24, “For
his body’s sake, which is the church,’' and Eph. 5 : 2 3, “Christ
is the head of the church and himself is the Saviour of his
body,’' and further on: “Christ loved the church and gave
himself for it that he might sanctify it, washing it with the
washing of water in the word of life that he might present it
to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or
anything of that kind, but that it should be holy and without
spot.''

Upon this text the holy doctors lean, as when Augustine
says, de doctrina Christi [3 z 37, Nic. Famem, 2 : 573]: “Christ
is the head of the church, which is his body destined in
the future to be with him in his kingdom and unending
glory.'' Gregory, Moralia, 35 : 9 [Migne, 76 : 762] says:
“Because Christ and the church are one, the head and the
body are one person.'' And on Ezekiel, homily 15, he says:
“The church is one substance with Christ, its head.” And
Bernard on the Canticles, homily 12 [Migne, 183 ε 831]:
“The church is Christ’s body, more dear than the body he
gave over to death.'' ¹ And Paschasius, de sacra. corporis
Christi [Migne, 120 : 128412 says: “Even as it is found in

¹The passage runs: “The church lives and eats of the living bread which
came down from heaven. She is the more precious body of Christ, and lest
she should taste of death the other was given over to death.’'

² This treatise of Paschasius, d. 865, usually quoted as de corpore et sanguine
Christi, is one of the most important treatises bearing on the development of
the doctrine of transubstantiation. Without using the word, Paschasius set
forth the view that in the Lord's Supper the very body “which was born of
the Virgin Mary, suffered on the cross and rose again‚'' is distributed by the
priest. He supports this view by the litera! interpretation of John 6: 54:
