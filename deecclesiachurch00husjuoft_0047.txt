INTRODUCTION xli

to discard Gratian's compilation as Luther did, who, in 1520,
threw the ponderous volume into the same flames at Witten-
berg which consumed Leo X’s bull. And the marvel is that
Huss, and Wyclif before him, should have been able to take
the advanced views they did with this heavy load of the
traditions of men—some good and some utterly anti-Scrip-
tural—weighing them down.

VII. THE TRANSLATION. This translation has been
made from the second edition of Huss's writings‚ entitled
Historia et Monumenta J. Hus, published in two volumes
at Frankfurt, 1715, with respectively 627 and 542 pages.
The edition is a reprint of the earlier edition, Frankfurt,
1558, also in two volumes.¹ The translator has had both
editions on his table, using the second on account of the
greater clearness of the print. After comparing the two
editions almost paragraph by paragraph, he has failed to
find a single verbal difference in the text. The only dif-
ferences are an occasional case of capitalization and punc-
tuation.

With exceptions, Huss's quotations are found to con-
form exactly to the vulgate, the text of the canon law and
the other texts which he quotes. It was the translator's
desire to examine one or more of the original manuscripts
of the treatise and through the courtesy of the eminent Huss
expert, Dr. Flajshans, of Prague, he received a list of the
more important manuscripts.² It was found impossible to
realize this desire; but from the accuracy with which Huss
has transferred quotations to his pages as found in the Frank-

1The de Ecclesia fills 75 double-columned pages, Mon„ 1 z 243-317. To
the librarian of Lane Theological Seminary the translator owes his thanks for
the use of the original edition as well as other valuable works as he is also
indebted to Dr. Henry Preserved Smith for the use of volumes from the
library of Union Theological Seminary, of which he is the librarian.

²The list of manuscripts, which includes exact descriptions‚ gives seven
in the Royal Library of Vienna, one in the Royal Library of Munich, one
in the Cathedral Gymnasium Library of Magdeburg‚ dated 1414, and four in
the university library of Prague. For a list of Huss’s works edited by Flajs-
hans, see Schaff‚ Life of Huss, p. 8.
