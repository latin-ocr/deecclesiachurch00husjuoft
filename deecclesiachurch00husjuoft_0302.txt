thirst! And what would be the fruit of such an appear-
ance? Certainly the neglect oi the work enjoined of God,
so far as his own salvation goes and the salvation of others.
Nor will he there be taught how to believe well, but how to
push litigation, which is not permitted to a servant of God.
There he will be despoiled in the consistory [curia], he will
grow cold in holy morals, he will be stirred up through op-
pression to impatience oi spirit, and, if he have nothing to
give, he will be condemned, even if he have justice on his
side. And what is more serious, he will be compelled to
adore with bended knees the pope as God.¹

Blessed, therefore, be God, who says: “I will go down
and see whether they have done altogether according to the
cry which is come unto me, and if not, Ι will know,'' Gen.
18 t 21. “Blessed be the Son of God, who came down from
heaven to seek and to save that which was lost,'' Luke 19 : 10.
“And he went about all the cities and the villages, teaching
in their synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the king-

¹ Cited by Cardinal Colonna to go to Rome, 1410, Huss, in his official replies,
his letters and at the council of Constance, constantly gave as a reason for not

by his course at the university. Other reasons he gave were that he would have
to leave his work in Prague, and that the place where the offence was com-
mitted, Prague, was the proper place for the trial. Wenzel‚ in a letter to the
cardinal, suggested that he visit Prague, Documenta, p. 424, and overlook the
situation with his own eyes. In one place Huss, in urging the distance as a
reason for not going to Rome, said the distance from Prague to the holy city
was as great as the distance from Jerusalem to Tiberius, which, however, hap-
pens to be only sixty miles.
