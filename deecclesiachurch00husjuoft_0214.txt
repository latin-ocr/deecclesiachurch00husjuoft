160 THE CHURCH

tainty to determine who the holy pastor really is, neverthe-
less we ought to decide by his works, which are conformed to
Christ's law, that he is such a pastor.

If, however, the pilgrim sees him living at variance with
Christ, to what other judgment can he come than that he
is antichrist's vicar, for Christ says: “Ye shall know thern
by their fruits‚'' Matt. 7 : 16, and “He that is not with me
is against me‚” Matt. 12 : 30. Here the Glossa ordinaria
says: “He that is not with me''—that is, does works dis-
similar to mine—“he is against me.'' If, therefore, a prel-
ate is proud, lives in luxury, follows after greed, is impa-
tient‚ does not seed the sheep, but oppresses and scatters
thern, is he not antichrist? Hence men may easily recog-
nize the wicked by their outward works which are contrary
to Christ3 but the good cannot be so known because hypocrisy
may lurk in thern.
