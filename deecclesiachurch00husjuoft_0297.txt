OBEDIENCE TO PRELATES 243

therefore, God teaches through them, but, if they wish to
teach their own things, do not hear them, do not do them.'’

Therefore, most true is Christ's saying and command, by
which it is clear that he does not command the keeping and
doing of all the precepts of those who sit in Moses' seat,
for otherwise he would not have said: “They lay heavy
burdens and grievous to be borne,'' and consequently bur-
dens which ought not to be borne. And in the next chapter
it is seen how he excused his disciples in respect to eating
with unwashen hands and fasting.

Then, as for the authority of Augustine (which the doc-
tors immediately append), the chapter preceding this, near
the end, gives his statement. As for the statement of St.
Jerome, on the explanation of saith, see Chapter XVI, where is
set forth what he had spoken to Pope Damasus. But, after
having looked at many old books, we have found that he
wrote to St. Augusffine, whom in his letters he often calls
pope—which Augustine was a true pope—giving one signif-

these things which are intermediate the law oi obedience is
placed as—tanquam—in the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil which was in the midst oi Paradise.'' Certainly, in these
things to prescribe our view to the judgment of the Masters
is not right; and in these things neither the command nor
the prohibition of prelates is in all cases to be despised.
Here it is to be observed that the adverb of similitude, “as''
[as it were]—-tanquam—expresses a certain amount os like-
ness, not full likeness. For in the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil the law was placed by God, who can neither
deceive nor be deceived. This law was given under pain of
mortal sin. For God said unto Adam: “Of the tree of the
knowledge oi good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, for
