208 THE CHURCH

can do nothing except for the building up and not for de-
stroying, for this is the plenitude of power to be able to do
all things to build up. These things, however, which they
call provisions, are not adapted to build up, but clearly to
destroy. Therefore, the most blessed apostolic see is not
able to make these provisions.’'1 These things by him of
Lincoln, who appealed from Pope Innocent to the tribunal
of Christ.

For this reason Castrensis, VII, tells how when Robert of
Lincoln was dead, a voice was heard in the papal curia, Come,
wretch, to thy judgment. And the pope was found the next
morning dead as if pierced in the side by the point of a staff.
And he of Lincoln, although noted for striking miracles, is
nevertheless not admitted to a place in the list os the saints.²

And it is clear that the pope may err, and the more griev-
ously because, in a given case, he may sin more abundantly,
intensely and irresistibly [than others]‚ as said Bernard in
his book addressed to Pope Eugenius:³ “More abundantly if
the sin extends to all Christendom, more intensely if his act
concerns the cure of souls and involves the withdrawal of
spiritual benefits, and more irresistibly if no one dares to
gainsay him, now in view of his alliance with the secular
arms, now in view of the cloaked censures which he fulmi-

¹ A provision is the gift oi a spiritual office or living by pope or bishop. The
theory was that all the livings in Christendom were in the pope’s hands for
bestowment, a theory receiving its full statement from Clement IV, 1265. See
Schaff, Ch. Hist„ V, part 2, 83 sqq. The Avignon popes, 1305—1377‚ appointed
two and sometimes three successors with right to succeed living incumbents
of ecclesiastical positions. A collation is equivalent to a provision.

2' The full quotation runs, Rolls Series, 8 z 242: “Robert was summoned
to the curia and excommunicated, but he appealed from Innocent's tribunal
to the bar oi Christ. Hence it happened after his death, Robert appeared to
that pope in the night while he was lying in bed, himself clad as a bishop and
said, Arise, wretch, and come to thy judgment. And straightway he pierced
him with his pastoral staff in the left side unto the beart, and so the pope's
bed was found in the morning full of blood and the pope was dead.'' Varia-
tions were given of this popular story. Matthew Paris, who has unbounded
admiration for Grosseteste, reports that on the night of his death strange bells
were heard.
