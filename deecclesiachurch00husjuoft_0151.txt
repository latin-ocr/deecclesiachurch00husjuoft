POWER OF BINDING AND LOOSING 97

conferred, the chain of damnation broken, and man reunited
with the church. This penance is performed by contrition,
confession and satisfaction.¹ Contrition‚ which is sorrow or
full pain for sin committed, must include displeasure with the
sin already committed, and the sin which may be committed
and, in the case—articulo—of necessity, such contrition is
enough for salvation. Hence the Saviour, knowing that the
mind of the adulteress was full of sorrow, added the words:
“Go and sin no more,'’ John 8: 11. For this reason St.
Augustine, St. Ambrose and St. Gregory agree in saying
that to be penitent is to lament evils done and not to wish
to do evils that are to be lamented.

Secondly, it is to be noted that, for the justification oi
the wicked man there is needed infinite power by which
God cleanses from spot and stain and grants grace. Again,
God's mercy is needed whereby he relaxes the offense done
his Majesty, and the eternal punishment for the debt which
would follow if he did not do penance. Therefore, the church
often prays, “Almighty and most merciful God,'' urging the
infinite power and mercy of God. But that infinite power
is required sor the justification of a wicked man is evident
because, as Augustine says, “it is easier to create a world
than to justify the wicked3 the first demands infinite power
and consequently also the second [act], and this is the reason
why, in the justification of the wicked, the active bestowal

¹ Penance is treated by Thomas Aquinas as a restoration to health. This
sacrament is the second plank thrown out for the sinner, as baptism is the first.
After the close of the twelfth century the four elements were considered neeffl-
sary parts of penance: contriti0n‚ confaesion to the prioet, satisfaction, and
absolution. Peter the Lombard still taught that confession to God was suffi-
cient for forgiveness. Alexander of Halae, d. 1245, made confession to the
priaet aesential, and he was followed by Thomas Aquinas. Absolution, which
from 1200 on has been regarded in the Catholic church as a judicial act, was
treated by Peter the Lombard as a declarative act, and the petitionary form
was still common in his day. Schwane, Dogmengesch. d. m. Z., p. 670, pro-
nouncae it the most important part of the sacrament οἱ penance. In his Com.
on the Lombard, p. 598 sqq„ Huss takes a moderate vieW, and on the basis of
the cas& of the penitent thies and publican, leans toward the opinion that con-
trition of heart and confession to God are sufficient.
