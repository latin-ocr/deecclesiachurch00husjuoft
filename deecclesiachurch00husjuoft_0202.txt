148 THE CHURCH

words. Therefore, it happens when a pastor walks along
steep places, the fiock follows him to the precipice”; because,
when laymen have learned the sayings of prelates, they are
perverted by their works. “Hence, it is written by the
prophet: ‘Wicked priests are the cause of the people's down-
fall,' and of these the Lord said through the prophet: ‘They
are made to be a stumbling-block of iniquity to the house
of Israel' [Hosea 5 : 8]. For indeed no one does more injury in
the church than he who acts perversely and yet has the name
and order of sanctity. For no one dares to oppose and re-

coming an example, when the sinner is honored on account
of the reverence paid to his order. For the unworthy would
flee the dangers of such a burden of guilt if they would care-
fully consider the meaning of the truth, namely, ‘Whoso shall
cause one of these little ones who believe on me to stum-

treadmill and sorrow of the secular life3 and by the ‘depth
of the sea' is meant utmost damnation. He, therefore, who,
led along by the appearance of sanctity, destroys others
either by word or example, would truly be far better off if
his worldly acts under an external cloak bound such an one
to death, rather than that the ministries of his sacred office
performed in guilt should show to others that he was change-
able, because, doubtless, if he was the only one to fall, a
more tolerable pain of hell would torment him.''

That Holy Pope knew the conditions and dangers inci-
dent to a prelate's life and especially incident to the position
of the Roman pontisf, inasmuch as his sin of commission and
omission would be a scandal to the wnole Christian people.
For it is said goodness in a pope is like salt for all, and
badness in him inures to the damnation of persons without
number, Dist. 40, Si Papa [Friedberg, 1 : 146]. If, therefore,
