ALL CHRISTIANS ARE NOT MEMBERS 25

separated by ruinous sin from holy church itself‚ but, neverthe-
less, are able by God's grace to corne to the sheepfold of the
Lord Jesus Christ. Of the latter Christ says: “Other sheep I
have which are not of this sold, and them I must bring‚'' John
10:16. Other sheep he had by virtue of predestination,
which are not of this fold and os his church according to
present righteousness, which sheep of his grace he brought
to life.

This distinction between predestination and present grace
deserves to be strongly emphasized‚ for some are sheep by
predestination and ravening wolves according to present right-
eousness‚ as Augustine deduces in his Commentary on John
[Nic. Fathers, 7 ε 253 sq.]: “In like manner some are sons
by predestination and not yet by present grace.'' And
this same distinction in both its parts Augustine touches
upon in his Exposition of John 11 : 52 [Nic. Famem, 7 : 278]‚
where it is said: “That they might gather together into one
the children of God who are scattered abroad.'' “ Caiaphas,’'
Augustine says, “was prophesying of the Jewish people only,
to whom the sheep belonged whom the Lord had in mind
when he said: ‘I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
house of Israel, ' but the Evangelist knew that there were other
sheep who were not of this fold which he had to bring. There-

might gather together into one the sons of God who are
scattered abroad.' These things, moreover, were said accord-
ing to the law of predestination, For, up to that time, they
were neither his sheep nor the sons of God.'' So much Augus-
tine. And in reference to these things it is said, de Penitentia‚
Dist. 4, Hoc ergo [Friedberg‚ 1 : 123 5]: “In this way they are
not children except as they are partakers of eternal blessed-
ness.'' And it is added: “They are called children in three
ways: either by predestination alone, as those of whom John
spoke that ‘he might gather into one the children of God who
are scattered abroad'; or by predestination and the hope of
