POWER OF BINDING AND LOOSING 109

tended then it is true that when the Lord said, “whatsoever, ''
he made no exception. For it means this: Whatsoever that
is 01 true penitence thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed
in heaven. Likewise, whatsoever that is 01 impenitence thou
shalt bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven. And with
this the Little Glosses¹ 01 the Decretists agree, which say that,
when the key does not make a mistake, and consequently when
a righteous thing is done on earth, it shall be confirmed in
heaven.

For every man who, being penitent‚ is according to the
rite loosed on earth by Christ’s vicar on the earth, he also
is loosed in heaven—just as he who has believed and is bap-
tized shall be saved, and he who has believed in love shall
be saved finally. For “believe'' here is to be accepted as
in John 3 ; 36, “He that believeth on the Son hath eternal
life,'' and 11 it shall be argued that whosoever believeth on
the Son hath eternal 111οε every Christian believes on the
Son 01 God, therefore every Christian hath eternal life—or,
again, 11 it be argued that whosoever believeth on the Son 01
God hath eternal 1110 but that reprobate, who is in grace, be-
lieves on the Son 01 God, therefore that reprobate has eternal
life—in these cases the conclusion is 13150. And both these
conclusions are invalid, because “to believe'' is one thing in
the major premise and another thing in the minor. Hence,
in order to correct the statement the argument must run
in this way: Whosoever believes with love in the Son 01
God and perseveres. In this case the consequence is good
[he shall be finally saved]. But the minor statement the
objector should prove [namely, that every Christian believes
with love 01 God]. Similar is the case with the second con-
clusion and its minor premise: namely, “that reprobate who
is in grace believes with love in the Son 01 God and perse-
veres.'’ This reasoning is false.

From the things already said, it 15 clear what the power
