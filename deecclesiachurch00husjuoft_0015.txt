IN T RODUCT ION xi

church—tenet et credit fideliter sicut Romana ecclesia et non
aliter—the pope being the head of the Roman church and
the college of cardinals its body. Of all names, so the doc-
tors confessed‚ the name heretic is the most to be abhorred.
As for the sentences pronounced by Rome upon Huss, it was
not within the province of the clergy of Prague to sit in
judgment upon them—nec est cleri in Praga judicare si justa
vel injusta est M. J. H us excommunicatio et aggravatio a curia
romana.

These and other positions of the eight doctors the Treatise
on the Church takes up one by one and discusses. Huss’s
work called forth replies from Palecz and Stanislaus of Znaim,
two of the signers of the document, and to each Huss made
a rejoinder as he also wrote a more elaborate and very vig-
orous rejoinder addressed to the eight doctors as a body.l
In the first two of these rejoinders Huss cites his Treatise
on the Church by name at least eleven times, and in the
Reply to the Eight Doctors at least five times.² The Treatise
on the Church grows in interest as it is read in connection
with these three cognate works, which further elucidate some
of its principles and add items of persona] interest.

Intended as a reply to the document issued by the eight
theological doctors, this treatise became Huss’s apologia pro
sua vita, the defense of the views which he had drawn from
Wyclif and advocated. With Cajetan before Luther at Augs-
burg, the eight doctors knew of only one word applicable
to Huss, the word recant. His case was not arguable. Un-
questioning submission was imperative. Rome had spoken:
“Yield and obey‚'' they wrote—obediendum et pariendum
est.³ Huss's final reply was not recorded with pen or ex-
pressed by word of mouth. He sealed his convictions with
his life at Constance.
