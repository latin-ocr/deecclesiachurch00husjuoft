20 THE CHURCH

the church by virtue of the power of communion and the
bond of love. Again as the members of the body keep them-
selves in their own function, so do also the members oi the
church. For, according to Chrysostom, de opere imperfecto,
a man is as a book in whom the whole Christian religion
is written, therefore, just as there is an affinity from the
head down to the feet, so reason and feeling are bound to-
gether. Also, just as every member, comely or uncomely,
serves the spirit without strife, so every member of the church
serves Christ, without any strife concerning supremacy and
obedience. And, just as the superior members do not boast
of their comeliness but perform their functions and follow
the soul’s rule unto the help of each single member, so ought
it to be with members of the church. And just as the eyes
and the countenance are in their activities without a covering
lest, if veiled, they might defile and prepare for destruction,
so Christ and the apostles, out of the fervor of their love and
by reason of their exemption from the fervor of lust, were not
involved in temporal interests in a secular way; and their
vicars, yea, all clerics ought to be like eyes. But the mem-
bers, less comely, as the secret parts, are more concealed and
more tender and multiplex, and so it is with mean¹ persons,
by whom the dregs of the church are gotten rid of. But the
difference between the members of these bodies is to be stated
thus: (1) Since the parts of the church persist by grace,
they are not concerned as to their place or corporal location,
as are the members oi the human body. (2) As the members
are mystical, it is not inconsistent but fitting that single
members should have functions of different kinds. For a man
is, as it were, a totality—universitas—so that it is fitting that
he should act all at once, so far as he is able. (3) The mem-
bers οἱ the church should have vital forces flowing into them
from Christ, just as the members of the body have vital forces

¹ contemptibilibus, a departure from the Vulgate word for ‘⁴ uncomely '' used
above—ignobile.
