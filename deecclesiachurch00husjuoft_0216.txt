162 THE CHURCH

It is certain that for all the faithful the Roman church is
the place which the Lord has chosen, the place where the
Lord has placed the primacy of the whole church, and the
high priest who occupies the primacy, and is set over that
place, is the pope, the true and manifest successor of Peter.
And the cardinals are the priests of the tribe of Levi who
are joined with the lord pope in the administration of the
priestly office, to whom in cases of doubt and difficulty re-

or malevolent‚ or perchance not a catholic but a heretic.’ ''

This exposition, so far as the principles go, I think flowed
chiefly from the head of Stephen Palecz, for by it he attempts
first to arouse the pope and the cardinals against the party
opposed to him, when he says: “Certain of the clergy of
Bohemia, leaning too little on the pope and the cardinals, do
not wish to agree to this'': namely, that the pope is the head
of the Roman church and the cardinals its body, the true
and manifest vicars of Christ. However‚ in regard to this
too little dependence, I say that, so far as their vanity, greed
and illegal commands g0, the pope with the cardinals ought
to be depended upon little. For so the Saviour put little
dependence upon the savorless salt, which was good for noth-

²Bcatissime papa. Huss has beatissimi papoe. Damasus, pope 366-384,
is said to have called upon Jerome to make his Vulgate translation.
