CHRIST THE ONLY HEAD OF THE CHURCH 29

particular church having several heads. For it may have
three heads, namely the divinity of Christ, his humanity, and
the chief appointed by God to rule over it. But there are
degrees of subordination in these heads, because the divinity
is supreme, Christ’s humanity is intermediate, and the chief
is the lowest. But the universal church, as has been said,
has two heads, the outward head which is the divinity and
the inward which is the humanity.

F urther, from these things it is seen that Christ from the
very beginning of the world down to his incarnation was,
in virtue of his divinity, the outward head of the church,

church, by virtue of his humanity. And so the whole holy
catholic church always has had and now has Christ as its

were before us? All who were righteous from the begin-
ning of the world have Christ for their head. For they be-
lieved that he was for to come whom we now believe to have
come, and in the faith in him they were healed, in which faith
we also are healed3 that he verily might be the head of the
whole city of Jerusalem, all the faithful being included from
