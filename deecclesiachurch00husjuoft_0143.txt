THE CHURCH FOUNDED ΟΝ CHRIST 89

there is required sor such an office as that of vicar conformity
of life and authority from the person instituting it, and to
this one [such a vicar] the Saviour at the Last Supper com-
mitted the institution of the venerable sacrament. And con-
stituting his disciples his vicars that they might so do in
remembrance of him, he said: “I have given you an ex-
ample that ye also should do as I have done to you,’' John
13 z 15. He also said: “Whosoever shall do and teach them
he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven‚'’ Matt.
5 : 19.

On this point St. Jerome ad Heliodorum, also Decretum,
Dist. 40 [Friedberg‚ 1 : 145], says: “It is not easy to fill the
place of Peter and Paul in occupying the chair—cathedra—
οἱ those who reign with Christ, because it was said, ‘they
are not the children of saints who hold the places of saints,
but they who do their good works.’'' St. Gregory [Fried-
berg‚ 1 : 146] says the same: “Neither places nor orders
make us near to our Creator, but our good works bind us
together or our evil works separate us.'' Likewise Chrys-
ostom, Dist. 40 : 12 [Friedberg‚ 1 : 147], says: “Many
priests there are, and few; many in name, and few in works.
See, therefore, how ye sit in the official chair, for the chair
does not make the priest, but the priest makes the chair:
the place does not sanctify the man, but the man the place.
Not every priest is holy; but every holy person is a priest.
He who sits well in the official chair gives¹ honor to the
chair; he who sits there ill does injury to it. Therefore
a bad priest gets criminality from his priesthood not dig-
nity.''

Likewise, we have this from the Acts os Boniface—Martyr
[Friedberg‚ 1 :146]: “If a pope neglect his own and his
brother’s salvation and be reproved as useless, remiss in his
acts, and above all keeping silent about the good2 because

¹ Facit. In the Decretum, accipit, “has received the honor of the chair.'’
² De bono, omitted by Huss.
