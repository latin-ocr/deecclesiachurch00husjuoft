EXCOMMUNICATIoNs, JUST AND UNJUST 271

back to Christ’s fold and to life eternal as a measure or-
dained for a final end. Therefore, St. Augustine, Romilia,
de penitentia, also 2 : 1, Multi, says: “Excommunication
ought not to be mortal but medicinal.'' Agaiu, Cum medi-
cinalis. de Sent. Excom„ liber 6: 7.¹ A notorious sinner
after the third warning or public citation, when he refuses
to be corrected, ought on account of his criminal offence to
be kept from communication according to the Saviour's com-
mand, where he said to Peter: “If thy brother sin against
thee, go show him his fault between thee and him alone.
If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he
will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more that at
the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be es-

15-17. This exposition is given above at the beginning of
Chapter XXI of this treatise‚ in which the conditions of a
true prelate are indicated. Nevertheless, this is yet to be
noted, that Christ said: “If he sin,'’ that is, commit the sin
of a criminal offence, for on that account he is deserving of
correction and he is not to be excommunicated for anything
whatsoever. But if he show himself incorrigible, after the
third reproof, then he ought to be carefully avoided as a
heathen Gentile and a publicam otherwise not. Let‚ there-

communicate so easily subjects for temporal gain.

Hence, St. Augustine, Sermo de Quadragesima: “We can-
not deprive of the communion, because this prohibition is
not yet morta] or medicinal, except in the case of one who
has of his own accord confessed or has been named or con-
victed in some secular or ecclesiastical tribunal.” And he also
says on these words, “If any man that is named a brother
