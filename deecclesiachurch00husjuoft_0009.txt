WYCLIF—

Vita et doctrina Christi sunt optimum speculum . . . cum mani-
festum sit quod omnis homo et sotum talis qui est in vita et doctrina
Christo contrarius est hereticus, et omnis christianus et solum talis qui
est in vita et doctrina Christo conformis est ut sic ab heresi elongatus.

-De Ecclesia, p. 41.

The life and teaching of Christ are the best mirror . . . for it is
evident that every man who in life and teaching is contrary to Christ
and only such a man is a heretic: and every Christian who in life and
teaching is conformed to Christ and only such a Christian is removed

from heraey.

HUSS- Spero, ex Dei gratia, quod sum christianus ex integro, a fide non

devians, et quod potius vellem pati diroe mortis supplicium, quam aliquid
vellem praeter fidem asserere, vel transgredi mandata Domini J esu Christi.
—Ad Palm, Mon„ 1 ε 325.

1 hope, by God's grace, that I am truly a Christian, not deviating
from the saith, and that 1 would rather suffer the penalty οἱ a terrible
death than wish to affirm anything outside of the [aith or transgress
the commandments of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Verum qui, in agone mortis, Iesum filium Dei passum pro nobis,
invocat et ob talem causam tanta fiducia ac constantia in ignem conjicit
sese, si is non magnanimum et sortem Christi martyrem sese prabet,
haud facile quisquam salvus erit.—Preface to some of Huss's writings,

1527.

Truly hffiHussr—who in the agony of death invoked Jesus Christ,
the Son oi God, who suffered for us, and for such a cause and with
such saith and steadfastness threw himself into the fire, if he did not
show himself a noble and brave martyr of Christ, then will scarcely
any one be saved.
