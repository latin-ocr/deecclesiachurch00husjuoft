 

ExcoMMUNJcATIONS‚ JUST AND UNJUST 269

a man is in grace, so long does he remain a partaker of the
aforementioned threefold communion, in respect to the law
of present righteousness. And as God is the most righteous
judge, He cannot damn a man except for his demerit in non-
participation of this kind. Therefore, the corollary is true.
(2) It follows that no judge may ever excommunicate in this
way unless the man himself shall before excommunicate him-
self by his offences. (3) It follows that no judge ought to
excommunicate any one except for a criminal offence¹ or on
account of mortal sin, and this is clear from 11 ε 3 [41, Fried-
berg, 1 : 655]‚ where it is said: “No bishop except for the
certain and evident cause of sin shall deprive any one whom-
soever from ecclesiastical communion by the anathema,
because the anathema is the eternal damnation of death,
and only for mortal sin ought it to be irnposed and only on
him who may not be otherwise corrected.'’ And it is also
said, 24 : 3, His ita respondetur [Friedberg‚ 1 : 988]: “With
God not the sentence of priests is sought but the life of the
guilty, for no one is to be known by the sentence to whom
the stain of sin does not adhere.'' Likewise, Lyra, Com. on
Hosea, 4, at the end, says: “O Judah, send Israel away, on
account of his wickedness, for their company is separated,
that is, excommunicated.” And also it is said by Augustine,
2 z 1, Multi, 5 [Friedberg‚ 1 :446]: “No one ought to be
excommunicated except for a criminal offence.''

All, however, agree in saying that excommunication is of
two kinds, major and minor, as is apparent from de Sent.
Excom. si quem de cleri excommunicat. fieri, de except. cap. 2
[Friedberg, 2 : 912] ² where it is stated that a minor excom-
munication removes from the participation of the sacraments
but the major separates from the communion of the faithful.

¹ A crimen or criminal offence is a violation of a natural law or a positive
divine commandment‚ as, for example, adustery, as opposed to a violation of
ecclesiastica! laW, delictum. Hergenffither, 549 sq„ 780 sq.

² Gregory IX’s Decretals‚ 5 ι 39, c. 50, and also 5 : 39, c. 1, make the dis-
tinction above made by Huss between major and minor excommunication, the
canon law running: ‘⁴ If any one pronouncffi the words, ‘1 excommunicate
