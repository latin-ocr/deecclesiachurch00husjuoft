THE LAW OF GOD 167

that man shall die.'' He did not sear to incur irregularity,
and if perchance he had been with the Jews in accusing
Christ, perhaps he would have said: “His blood be upon
us and upon our children3 for we have a law and by that
law he ought to die.'' Pilate was not, therefore, excused be-

and elders of the people, Pilate and the soldiers, yea, and
by the crowd shouting, “Crucify Him, crucify Himl'' did
they justly condemn Christ the Lord? Yea, truly, because
