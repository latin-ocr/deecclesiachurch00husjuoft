THE CHURCH

CHAPTER I

THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH

AS every earthly pilgriml ought faithfully to believe the
holy catholic church just as he ought to love Jesus Christ,
the Lord‚ the bridegroom of that church, and also the church
herself, his bride; but as he does not love this, his spiritual
mother, except he also know her by saith—therefore ought he
to learn to know her by saith, and thus to honor her as his
chief mother.2

Theoefore, in order to reach a proper knowledge of her, it
is to be noted, (Ι) That the church signifies the house of God,
constituted for the very purpose that in it the people may
worship its God, as it is written, I Cor. 11 z 22: “Have ye not
houses to eat and to drink in?'' Or, to speak with Augustine:
“Do you despise the church of God, the house of prayer?'’
(2) The church signifies the ministers belonging to the house
of God. Thus the clerics belonging to one material church
call themselves the church. But according to the Greeks, a
church—ecclesia—is a congregation—congregatio-held to-

¹ Viator, a current word. See Wyelif‚ de Eccles„ 4, 42, 350. Gerson‚ Du
Pin's ed„ 2 ι 22.

² See also chap. II, etc. The designation mother is nowhere given to the
church in the N. T. It is derived from the relation the church bears to Christ
as his bride. Later on in this chapter Augustine represents her as giving birth
to children. So Wyclif‚ de Eccles„ 117: “The church is a virgin since she is
the bride of the virgin Jesus Christ, by whom as a mother we are born after a
spiritual manner.'' It followed that Christ was the spiritual father or “father
by faith‚'’ Wyclif, p. 1, and Grosseteste in this treatise, chap. IV. In his
Com. on the Lombard, p. 469, Huss speaks of the church as “our most dear
mother, the most worthy mother of the predestinate.”
