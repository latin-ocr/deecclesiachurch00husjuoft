THE CHURCH WITHOUT POPE 155

keep God’s law, the Lord said: “I say unto you, the king-
dom of heaven shall be taken away from you and shall be
given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,’' Matt.
21 z 43. These words the Saviour spoke to the priests when
they alone bore sentence against themselves in that they said:
“He will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out
the vineyard to other husbandmen who shall render him the
fruits in their seasons.'’ How, therefore, is the hand of the
Lord shortened that He is not able to cast out the pope and
the cardinals and appoint others in their places who, though
they have no titles, will build up the church as the Lord did

And later on he says: “When they were deceased, bishops
arose in their places.'' And here the Gloss says, Argumentum,
that “every bishop is equal in apostolic power by virtue of
his ordination and the ground of his consecration.” The same
is clear from Decretum, 24 : 1, Loquitur ad Petrum [F ried-
berg, 1 ε 971], where Cyprian, the bishop and martyr, says
that “after his resurrection Christ conferred on all the apos-
tles equal power.'' This also appears from what Jerome
says, Dist. 95, Olim [Friedberg, 1 : 332]: “The same person
formerly was both presbyter and bishop, before rivalries had
been started by the insinuation of the devil, and before it
was said amongst the people, ‘ I am of Paul and I of Apollos.' ''

Likewise, all archbishops, patriarchs and bishops, at the
council of Pisa who recognized, determined and condemned
