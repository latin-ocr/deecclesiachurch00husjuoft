OBEDIENCE To PRELATEs 255

authority extends to the right of infinite commanding, and
whom individual Christians ought to obey even to that ex-
tent. How many, namely, acts he may lawfully do, since
it matters not whether the subject, following the command
of a priest binding him to penance, gives two pennies or two
denarii or fasts three days weekly; and that he give as many
pennies or fast as many days as the simple fellow commands
or limits (unless he fill his confessor's purse), or that he
give as much for the building of St. Peter as he would
offer if he lived there and as much by the estimate of the
pope's camera as he might consume on the journey thither;
and so of other taxations invented of the devil. The faith-
ful ought also to think of the circumstance of the end in
view, namely: why, that is, with what end in view he ought
to obey by the act which is enjoined, because, if it leads
to God’s honor and directly to the profit of the church,
then it is a good end. But if another end is held forth, then
it is against the apostle’s words: “Whatsoever ye do, do in
the name of Jesus Christ.'' For the end determines all the
means—media—which are used with that end in view. Hence,
Aristotle concludes, de Anima, 2, with these words: “It is
right that all things should be called good by the end, so
that when the end is good, the means for that end are also
good.'' And another circumstance is also added, when it is
said: how. For it is not enough to do a thing that is good
generically, but it is demanded that it be done well, for noth-
ing can be done well by a man except as he abides in love.
Therefore, the apostle says: “Let all your things be done
in love.'' And that nothing is well done by a man without
love, the apostle proves when he says: “Though I bestow all
my goods to seed the poor, and have not love, it profiteth
me nothing,'' I Cor. 13 : 3. And this is reasonable because
the branch cannot bear fruit, except it abide in the vine, as
the Saviour said: “Ye cannot bear fruit, except ye abide in
me,'' that is, by love, John 15 z 4. Hence it is said in a gen-
