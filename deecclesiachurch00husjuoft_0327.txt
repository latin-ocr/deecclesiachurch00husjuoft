 

EXCOMMUNICATIONS, JUST AND UNJUST 273

cate themselves when they put excommunication on others,
or publish it, and especially the clerics who, as it were, every
day at prime sing: “Cursed are they who depart from thy
commandments.''

This much, in brief, with respect to excommunication‚ in
regard to which that good Christian of holy memory and
that great zealot oi Christ's law, Master Frederick Epinge,
bachelor of canon law, treating of the first article, said: “No
prelate ought to excommunicate anybody unless he first knows
that the person has been excommunicated by God.'’ Of this
I have written in another place. And, if thou wilt not be-
lieve it, learn it on the wall in Bethlehem,1 and there thou
wilt find how excommunication does not injure the righteous
but profits and why even the righteous ought to sear unjust
prelatic or Pilatic excommunication‚ and for these reasons, (1)
that he may not be guilty at some other place or time. (2)
The danger to him who unjusz excommunicates. (3) The
injury to the brethren which may follow from a foolish ap-
plication of censures; (4) that they may not become an occa-
sion of stumbling by going back from the truth; (5) that they
may not suffer an injury by an excommunicated person's
curses; (6) that he by impatience may not fall from merit or
depart from righteousness——and also for other reasons ex-
plained more fully and pertinently in another place.²

¹Huss refers to the six inscriptions on the walls of Bethlehem chapel,
Mon„ 1 : 237-243, which were intended to counteract six errors about the
mass—namely, that the priaet creatos the body of Christ; saith—name1y‚
that saith is exercised in Mary, etc., and not in God only; absolution from sin
—namely, that the prifflt absolves whomsoever he will; obediencoenamely,
that subjects are bound to obey all commands issued by superiors; excommu-
nication3 and simony‚ which, so the inscription read, “the clergy for the most
part, alas! practise.” In regard to the fifth, excommunication, the inscrip-
tion ran: “It is an error that every excommunication, just or unjust, binds
the excommunicated person and separates him from the communion of Christ's
faithful and deprivae him of the sacraments.’' Epinge's name I do not find in
Schulte or Chevalier.

²Thaee six reasons for standing in fear even of an unjust sentence of ex-
communication. Huss quotes from memory, leaving out one which he had given
in his de sex Erroribus, M on„ 1 : 240. Some of thaee reasons he sets forth
