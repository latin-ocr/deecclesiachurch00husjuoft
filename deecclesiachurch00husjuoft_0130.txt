76 T HE CHURCH

received from him the keys of the kingdom of heaven in
the person of Peter, that is, the power of binding and loosing
sins. For what the church is essentially in Christ, that Peter
is symbolically in the Rock—Petra—-by which symbolism
Christ is understood to be the Rock and Peter the church.
Therefore‚ this church which Peter represented, so long as she

of stumbling and a Rock of offense. For they stumble at the
word and do not believe that whereunto they were appointed.'’
Paul also said: “Israel following2 after a law of righteousness
did not arrive at the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Be-

bled at the stone of stumbling, as is written, Behold I lay in
Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, and he that be-
lieveth on him shall not be put to shame,'' Romans 9 ε 31 sqq.
Behold how these two Roman apostles and bishops, Peter
and Paul, prove from Scripture that the Lord Jesus Christ is
