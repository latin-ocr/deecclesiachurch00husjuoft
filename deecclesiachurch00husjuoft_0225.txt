THE LAW OF GOD 171

as a publican and gentile. What ground, therefore, is there
for the argument from comparison [with those who put Christ
to death]? Under the old law the disobedient person was
to be put to death, therefore, also under the law of grace.
Even Christ's disciples have been deceived by this argument
from comparison, for after the manner of Elijah the prophet,
they wanted the Samaritans who refused to receive Christ
to be consumed by fire from heaven, saying: “Lord, wilt
thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven and con-
sume them?'' That most good priest and best of masters
reproved them, for the words follow that he, turning around,
rebuked them, saying: “Ye know not what spirit ye are of,
for the Son of Man came not to destroy souls but to save
them‚'' Luke 9 : 54—56.

This good Gospel the doctors did not turn to and so they
have joined to their statements this sanguinary corollary—
sanguinolentum corollarium—and say: “If any of the clergy
be found in Bohemia acting contrary to these premises or
a single one of them, such an one is to be corrected by ecclesi-
astical censure and, if he refuses to be corrected, he is to be
turned over to the secular tribunal.'' For a certainty in this

¹ This is one of the rare protests before the Reformation against the bloody
practice of putting heretics to death. In his Reply to Eight Doctors‚ M on„
1 :382 sqq„ Huss takoe up again at length the treatment of heresy. The
definite position taken by the church was that they should be put out of the
world. The laws of Frederick ΙΙ ordered death by burning for all heretics
and the church well knew that when it turned a heretic over to the civil power,
though its sentence asked for mercy, the death penalty would follow. In
fact, as Vacandard has shown, the ecclesiastic& court sometimes actually pro-
nounced the death penalty and carried it out, and popes and other eccle-
siastics demanded on pain of excommunication the summary treatment by the
civil authorities of persons condemned by the church. See Schaff: John Huss.
It would have been well if Calvin and Beza had made the same distinction
between the Old Taetament and the New which Huss makes in the preceding
paragraph. In this case, they would not have justified the execution of here-
tics upon the basis of the examples given in the Old Taetament. A strong
passage in Huss’s treatise against indulgences, th„ 1:223, runs: “The
Saviour taught Peter and in him his vicars and pontiffs in their necessities to

flee to God in prayer and not to money or physical battle.’' For a more
elaborate treatment of putting heretics to death, etc.‚ see ad octo Doctores,
