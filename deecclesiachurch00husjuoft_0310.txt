256 THE CHURCH

eral way that a certain philosopher, by name Phantasma—
Illusion—advanced that God is the rewarder not of nouns
but adverbs [not names, but qualities]‚ and it is clear that
for obedience to be true, grace or love is needed. Then
other circumstances are involved in this adverb, how, be-
cause one that is called upon to obey ought to perform the
work commanded out of love, in humility, wisely‚ joyfully,
bravely, and promptly. The last condition is when—namely‚
it is fitting to perform the work commanded, as has been
said before, with respect to time, for without doubt there
are many acts good generically and also acts neutral, which
it is not expedient to command at any time whatever, and
consequently it is not expedient to yield obedience to them
at any time.

However, as for this [namely, that the inferior obey the
superior in all things], it is argued up to this point thus:
Suppose that the pope should, by the bond of holy obedience
and upon the assurance of obtaining absolution from penalty
and guilt or some other spiritual benefit, bind every cleric
subject to him to resist the first pope obedient in all things,
and that he should bind every laic by a similar formula to
resist the first disobedient pope and let the injunction be
made under the severest of anathemas-and suppose in ad-
dition that every cleric or laic subject to our pope was first
obedient to him and that every cleric resisted every laic
and vice versa. Here the contradiction would be mani-
fest because it is allowed that Peter the cleric and Paul the
laic were not at first in opposition, resisting one another, and
Ι ask whether Peter being for the moment obedient is re-
sisting the pope. If so, then we must say that for that mo-
ment Paul was disobedient to the pope because, inasmuch
as he resists Peter who is disobedient to the pope in all things,
and it was enjoined that he should resist the first disobe-
dient pope, it follows that Paul incurs the mark of disobe-
dience, and so also Peter for the moment being disobedient
