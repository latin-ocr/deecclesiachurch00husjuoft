198 THE CHURCH

the glory of Jesus Christ, as it is said: “Ye also shall sit upon
twelve seats,'’ Matt. 19 : 28. Here Augustine understands
by seats the location of the apostles and of all holy predes-
tinated prelates which, since it is in blessedness‚ cannot cease
to be or suffer destruction at the hand of tyrants. But the
Twelve—-duodenarius—which is the whole number, does not
indicate those twelve apostles man for man, for Iscariot
ruled at that time and Paul was yet to become a part of
the number.

But the seat of Christ's majesty is to be understood as
the location of the eternal kingdom from which none can
be removed. And that seat of Christ is his seat intrinsically,
but his externa] seat in which he reposes‚ dwells and resides
by grace is all the saints, just as, on the other hand, the
seats of Satan in which Satan reposes‚ dwells and resides are

to the principal proposition, the apostolic see is the same as
the cathedra—seat—-of Moses, of which the Saviour said:
“The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' cathedra‚'' Matt.
23: 2. But Moses' cathedra was not Moses nor an old
stone or wooden seat on which Moses sat as a presiding
judge. Nor is it the synagogue, but that cathedra is the
authority to teach and judge the people. And this is shown
by Christ's words, when he said, “in Moses' cathedra.''
And the words follow, “Whatsoever they say,'' that is, teach
by the authority and doctrine of Moses, “that do.'' There-
fore the apostolic see is the authority to teach and judge
according to Christ’s law, which the apostles taught, and-¹
