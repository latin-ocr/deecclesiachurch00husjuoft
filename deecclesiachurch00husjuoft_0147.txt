POWER OF BINDING AND LOOSING 93

Secular power is twoiold, civil and common. Civil power,
which is authoritative, belongs only to the civil lord. But
civil power, which is vicarious‚ belongs to officials or servants.
But secular power, which is common to all, is the power by
which a man is able to rule himself and his own according
to the gifts of nature and of fortune. And thus, just as a
man cannot be a whole man without body and soul, nor is
the adopted child of God complete without the gifts of na-
ture and of grace, so the pilgrim cannot get along as a pil-
grim unless he has both secular and spiritual power which
are common to all, although this is bound in the case of
infants and the dead. But spiritual power is everywhere
the more perfect and the sacerdotal power exceeds the power
of kings in dignity as appears from Heb. 7 : 7: “Greater is
he that blesses and less is he who is blest.''

Hence the spiritual power, which is sacerdotal, excels the
royal in age, dignity, and usefulness. In age it excels, be·
cause the priesthood was instituted by God's command, as
appears from Ex. 28. Later at God's command the kingly
power was instituted by the priesthood, as appears from
Deut. 17 and I Sam. 12. In dignity it excels, as already
said, because the priest as the greater blesses, consecrates
and anoints the king. And the usefulness is evidently greater
for the reason that the spiritual power is in and of itself suf-
ficient for the ruling of the people, as appears from the his-
tory oi Israel, which down to the time of Saul was salubri-
ously administered independent oi the kingly authority.
T herefore, the spiritual power, inasmuch as it concerns the
best things—things having their sufficiency in themselves-—
excels the earthly power, since the latter is of no avail inde-
pendent of the spiritual power which is the chief regulative
force. On the other hand, the spiritual power may act by
itself without the aid of the earthly power. And, for this
reason, the priests who abuse this power, which is so exalted,
by pride or other open sin, fall all the lower with the devil
