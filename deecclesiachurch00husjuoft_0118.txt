64 THE CHURCH

and at the close of the chapter it is stated how Barnabas led
Paul to Antioch and they were together for a whole year in
the church and taught great multitudes, so that “ the disciples
were called Christians first in Antioch,’' Acts 11 ε 1, 26.

In the second sense, the Roman church is taken to mean
any pope together with any cardinals‚ wherever they may
happen to reside, whether their lives are good or evil. And
in the third sense, it is taken for the pope. These two last
senses are wrested by scholars. For there is no good reason
for calling the Roman church our mother either (1) on ac-
count of its pride or (2) on account of the emperor's clement
goodness in endowing the church or on account of the pope’s
haughtiness and sels-assertion because of imperial rule drawn
from the pope's primacy or dominion‚ (3) or, again, is this
a good reason that men should believe that it is incumbent
upon every Christian to have recourse to the pope and that
it is of necessity for salvation to recognize him as the head
and as the most holy father, but for other reasons than this.
For since the term Roman church was established aside from

Peter’s incumbence as bishop-—cathedrationis—and afterwards
in Rome at the time of the preaching and martyrdom of
Peter and Paul. And so is to be understood the Saviour's
saying‚ Matt. 12 : 28, “Finally is the kingdom of God come

is within you . . . for where the body is, thither will the eagles
also be gathered together.'' For, although the Christian
church began in Judea and Christ suffered martyrdom in
Jerusalem, nevertheless with reason Christ's church is called
the Roman church in view of a certain pre-eminence and for
three causes: (1) Christ knew that the peoples under the
Roman empire would be brought in in the place of the unbe-
