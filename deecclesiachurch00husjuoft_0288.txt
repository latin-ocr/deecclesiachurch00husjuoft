2 34 THE CHURCH

11 143, “and to be called of men Rabbil’' Matt. 23 : 7.
Likewise in acts good generically, as are fasting and
prayer—which are not things absolutely evil—the Roman
church and prelates are not to be obeyed except as these
acts are weighed in the balances of reason. This is plain
because an inferior must continue in prayer and fasting, so
far that the neglect to do so would mean damage to him-
self and the church3 but this is to be avoided both by him
who commands and by the inferior3 therefore, the antecedent
is true. For it is certain that it would be tempting God to

the disciples of John saying, Why do we and the Pharisees
fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?’' Matt. 9 : 14. To these
calumniators who joined themselves with the Pharisees in
reproving Christ, the Saviour replied for his disciples and
said: “Can the sons of the bridegroom mourn as long as the
