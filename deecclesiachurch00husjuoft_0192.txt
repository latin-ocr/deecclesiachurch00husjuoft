138 THE CHURCH

he does not make the college of the apostles the body of the
church‚ I Cor. 12 : 28, but he says: “God hath set some in
the church, first apostles, second prophets, thirdly teachers,
then miracles, then gifts of healings,” etc. And making a
comparison of the body of the church with a man's natural
body, he says, “For as there is one body and it has many
members but all the members of the body being many are
one body: so also is Christ,'' namely, he is one, because he is
one person with his holy church, which is his body.

The second part of this statement, that all the predesti-
nate are not that college, is evident of itself. T herefore, better
would the doctors have said that Christ is the head os the
holy Roman church‚ and each of the predestinate a member
and that all together are the body, which is the church, than
to have said that the pope is the head of the Roman church
and the college of cardinals the body, for in this case they
would have agreed with the apostles and with the saints
quoted in Chapter I, especially with St. Augustine, de doct.
christ. III [Nic. Fathers, 2 : 569], who says: “For, in truth‚
that is not the Lord’s body which will not remain with him
through eternity.'' 1 If, therefore, the college of cardinals
will not remain through eternity, a thing which is hidden
from me, how is it the body of the holy Roman church or
of Christ? In a similar way, how is the pope with the afore-
said college the holy Roman church against which the gates
of hell cannot prevail?

Therefore, we will speak more safely with St. Augustine
who, Commentary on Psalms, 80 ε 1 [Nic. Fathers, 7 : 386],
says: “Finally by this testimony, the confession is made
both of Christ and the vine that is the head and the body,
king and people, shepherd and fiock, and the whole mystery

¹ Augustine here, in reply to Tychonius, the Donatist, denies that the “body
of the Lord'' can be properly said to be “twofold.'' The full quotation is:
“Twofold is not ‘a suitable word, for that is really no part of the body of Christ

which will not be with him in eternity.’'’ Hypocrites may be said to belong
to the mixed church, but not to be of “the body of Christ.''
