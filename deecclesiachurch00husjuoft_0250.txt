196 THE CHURCH

the honor of God, the prosperity of the church and the sal-
vation of the people, and who does God’s will and uncovers
the wiles of antichrist‚ preaching the law of Christ—he has
the marks which show that God sent him.

As to “glory‚'' Christ said: “I receive not glory from
men,'’ John 5 : 41, and, “I seek not mine own glory,'’ John
8: 50. As to the second thing, he said: “1 came in my
Father's name and ye received me not. If another would
come in his own name, him ye will receive‚'' John 5 : 43.
In regard to the third thing, Christ said: “I am come down
from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him
that sent me‚’' John 6 : 38. Christ so did because he sought
the prosperity of the church and the people’s salvation. As
for the fourth thing, he said: “The world hateth me, be-

finally Christ shows that he was sent from God to do the
works of the Father: “If I do not the works of my F ather,
believe me not; but if I do them, though ye believe not

shall they preach unless they be sent?'‘ Romans 10 ε 15.
Therefore‚ St. Augustine, Quaestiones Orosii, 65, thus answers
the question of Orosius how we may know who are sent by God:
“Recognize that one as sent by God whom the praise of a
few men or rather their flattery did not choose, but him
whom the best life and morals and examination have ap-
proved to the judgment of apostolic priests or all the people—
the man who does not hanker after pre-eminence‚ who does
not give money as the price of the episcopal honor. For he
who hastens to secure pre-eminence, as one of the Fathers
finely expresses it, ‘Let him know that it does not profit
