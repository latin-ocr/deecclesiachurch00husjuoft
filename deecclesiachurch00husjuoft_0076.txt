22 THE CHURCH

proves, Romans 8 : 28 sqq„ when he says: “We know that
to them that love God all things work together for good, even
to them that are called to be righteous according to his pur-
pose‚'' that is, the purpose of predestination. “For whom he
foroknew, them he also predestinated to be conformed to the
image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many
brethren. And whom he predestinated, them he also called;
and whom he called, them he also justified.⁷' And he con-
cludes by calling them predestinate after suffering a long trial
when he said: “I am persuaded that neither death nor life,
nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
nor things to come, nor might,l nor depth, nor any creature
shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is
in Christ Jesus our Lord.''

Besides, it is to be noted that, as many say, the relation
of pilgrims to holy mother church is fourfold. Some are in
the church in name and in fact, as are predestinate Catholics,
obedient to Christ; some are neither in fact nor in name, as
are the reprobate heathen; some in name only, as are reprobate
hypocrites; and some are in the church in fact, although they
may seem in name to be outside, as are predestinate Christians
whom the satraps of antichrist seem to be damning before the
very eyes of the church, ior so pontiffs and Pharisees con-
demned by bitter death our Redeemer as a blasphemer, and
consequently as an heretic, “who was predestinated to be
the Son of God '' (Romans 1 : 4).

Further, it is to be noted that no place, or human election,
makes a person a member of the holy universal church, but
divine predestination does in the case of every one who per-
sists in following Christ in love. And, according to Augustine
—de predestinatione sanctorum [Nic. Fatlzers‚ 5 :498 sqq]—
predestination is the election of the divine will through grace;
or, as it is commonly said, predestination is the preparation

“nor height.”
