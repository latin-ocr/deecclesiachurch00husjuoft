THE ABUSE OF SCRIPTURE 117

often as thy tongue sounds the praises of God, so often thy
life blasphemes.” How, then, shall the avaricious, simoniacs‚
the self-indulgent and those guilty of other crimes think in
goodness of heart about the Lord or about his sacraments
when they, like infidels, despise the Lord’s name, defile his
bread, crucify to themselves the Son of God and put him
to an open shame‚ deal wickedjy with God's law and despise

government and blaspheme?
It is also clear that to this class belong the pestiferous

clergy who, in an infidel way, think of the seven sacraments
of the church and of the keys and of other things belonging
to Christ’s law. It is also clear that the dictum of the doc-
tors—whose leader at that time was Stephen Palecz, supported
by Stanislaus, who led after them Peter of Znaim, John He-
liae, Andrew Broda, John Hildissen‚ Matthew the Monk,
Herman the Hermit, George Boras, and Simon Vuenda—
laid down as a statement of the matter of disagreement, is
to be verified by the conduct of the clergy who were living
in sin.¹ For, in the beginning of their writing‚ they say:
“The matter of this disagreement is manifest from the lives
of some of the clergy who are pestiferous.'' Because Christ’s

¹ The document referred to (Doc.‚ 475 sqq.) was signed by eight doctors of the
theological faculty of the university of Prague against the XLV Articles of Wyclif
and seven other articles alleged to give Huss’s views, such as that the priest
does no more than announce the forgiveness of sins in the sacrament of pen-
ance. It was an attack upon Huss for the hostile position he had assumed to
the sale of indulgences ordered by John XXIII, 141 1. The disturbances which
followed in Prague led the king, Wenzel, to call the eight magisters and Huss
before him at his summer residence of Zebrak. There, after a meeting in the
parish house at which Palecz read a paper charging Huss with disobedience to
the university authorities, they appeared before the king. Huss offered to
submit himself to the ordeal of fire provided that the others did and that the
party not proving its case from Scripture should undergo it. The proposition
was not accepted, the meeting seems to have come to naught, and the disturb-
ances in Prague went on, and the three men were murdered to whom reference is
made in a succeeding chapter. Huss made an elaborate Reply to the Eight
Doctors, Mon„ 1 : 366-408, in which he goes into the scriptural authority
limiting the papal power of indulgence and the priestly power of remissiori of
sins. The eight doctors included the names given above with the exception
of Boras and Vuenda. See ad Stanisl„ Mon„ 1: 331.
