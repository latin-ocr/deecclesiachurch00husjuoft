42 THE CHURCH

As to the fourth proof, which runs, “Whosoever therefore
shall do one of these least commandments''—to this St.
Augustine aptly replies, Com. on John 21 : 11 [Nic. Fathers,
7 : 4431, where Simon Peter is said to draw “the net to
land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three.'' St.
Augustine says: ‘“Whosoever will break one of these least
commandments and shall teach men so, shall be called least
in the kingdom of heaven; but whoso shall do and teach them
shall be caHed great in the kingdom of heaven.' The latter,
therefore, would belong to the number of the great fishes.
But the former, that is, ‘the least, ' who in act breaks what he
teaches in word, may be in such a church, which contains
those who are represented by that first catch of fishes, which

fish, ' a parable by which he wishes both the good and the bad
to be understood. And of these he says that they are to be
separated on the shore, namely, at the end of the world.
Then, in order to show that these ‘least' are the reprobate, who
teach good things with their lips and break them by their bad
living, and will not be as the ‘least' in the future in the life
eternal‚ yea will not be there at all, for he had said, ‘He shall
be called least in the kingdom of heaven,’—-Christ went on
to say: ‘For I say unto you, except your righteousness shall
exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees‚ ye shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven.' Certainly, these are
the scribes and Pharisees who sit in Moses' seat and of whom
Christ said: ‘Whatsoever things they say, these do ye, but
whatsoever things they do, these do not ye, for they say and
do not‚' Matt. 23 ε 2. They teach in words what they break
in their lives. Therefore the conclusion is that he who is
‘least in the kingdom of heaven,' the church now being made
up of such as it is, will not enter into the kingdom of heaven,
the church being then what it is to be; because, in teaching
