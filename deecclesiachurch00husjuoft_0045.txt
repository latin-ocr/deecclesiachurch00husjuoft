INTRODUCTION xxxix

From the university of Bologna, which became the celebrated
centre of the study of both laws, such eminent popes went
out as Alexander III and Innocent ΙΙΙ, and the advice of
its jurisconsults was sought on questions of first import, as
by Frederick Barbarossa on the plain oi Roncaglia, 1158.

In his Concordantia canonum discordantium, usually called
Decretum Gratiani, Gratian attempted to bring into a har-
monious code the statements of councils, popes, and eminent
Fathers bearing on all manner of questions concerning the
government of the church and its usages. This digest had
even greater authority in its department than Peter the
Lombard’s Sentences in the department oi systematic theol-
ogy. In its sections are also contained the fictitious materials
of the pseudo-Isidorian decretals‚ the most notorious portion
of which is the donation of Constantine.

As time wore on, the need was felt of supplements to
Gratian's work, which were furnished in the Decretals‚
so-called, collected by order oi Gregory IX, 12 342¹ the Liber
Sextus or Sext, by Boniface VIII, 1298, the Liber Septimus or
Clementine ConstitutionS‚ by Clement V, 1314,2 and the so-
called Extravagantes‚ or fugitive decretals‚ twenty in number,
issued by John XXII and incorporated into the code by John
Chappuis in his edition of 1500. Chappuis also added severity
other decretals issued between the pontificates of Boniiace
VIII and Sixtus IV, 1294-1484. The completed digest, con-
sisting of these parts, was authoritatively issued by Gregory
XIII, 1582.3

The Glosses and Little Glosses, which Huss frequently
quotes—the Glossa ordinaria—are comments made upon the
original texts by glossators, among whom Cardinal Zabarella,
