180 THE CHURCH

(8) A. D. 1047 Bene-dict, who got into the papacy by
simony, an illiterate man, had another consecrated pope with
himself to perform the ecclesiastical duties for him—namely,
Sylvester; and, as this did not please many, a third was brought
in who was to fill the places of the other two.

(9) A. D. 1046, when at Rome one pope was contending
against two and two against one over the papacy, King
Henry proceeded to Rome against them; and when they were
deposed, Clement was chosen to preside. By him Henry
was consecrated emperor, and the Romans swore never again
to elect a pope without the emperor’s consent. Then was
constituted the law, III Reg., 2, that, following the example
of Solomon, the king in case of necessity is bound to depose
the pontiff. Then King Henry humbly received at the hands
of Clement consecration‚ and thereafter without such con-
firmation no other was to be regarded as emperor. But
why was this necessary in accordance with the law of God,
since, prior to the institution of the cardinals, it was held that
the pope was elected by the people of Rome?l

(10) A. D. 1068, while two were contending at Rome for
the papacy and Alexander, after he had established his inno-
cence against the charge of simony, was received and Cada-
lus, bishop of Parma, condemned. Hence, it was said: “Ca-
dalus, in Parma, was made by me bow and arms. Cadalus
died3 Parma was made a ruin.'’ 2

(11) A. D. 1083 Henry broke into the city of Rome and
placed Wibert in the apostolic chair. Hildebrand departed
to Beneventum, where he remained till his death.³

him aside and restored Leo VIII, Benedict being placed under charge of the
archbishop of Hamburg and dying in Germany.

¹ The three popes disposed of at Sutri, 1046.

² Alexander ΙΙ, 1061-1073‚ gave offense by being elected by the cardinals
and entering upon the papacy without the emperor's confirmation. Agnes,
the queen regent and mother of Henry IV, called a synod, which elected Cad-
alus. of Parma, known as Honorius ΙΙ. The latter died 1072.

³ This is the famous Wibert of Ravenna, Clement 111, who was elected anti-
pope at the instance of Henry IV against Henry's opponent, Gregory VII.
