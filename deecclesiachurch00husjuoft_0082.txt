28 THE CHURCH

they were servants of that one Head and humble ministers
of the church, his bride. No one of the apostles ever pre-
sumed to claim that he was the head or the bridegroom of
the church, for this would have meant to adulterate with
the queen of heaven and to arrogate the name of dignity
and office—the dignity by which, according to the eternal
predestination‚ and the office through which, by eternal ap-
pointment, God ordained that Christ should be supreme ruler
of his bride. This also appears from St. Augustine's letter
to Dardanus [Migne's ed., 33 : 832 sqq.], where he says:
“She only has one head, namely him who rules over her, ex-
celling all and typifying in one union the spiritual and secular
rule.'’

T herefore, it is possible to understand the “ Head of the
Church'' in a twofold sense: inward and outward. In the
inward sense, as the chief person of his church, and he is this
in two ways: either by superintendence over the material
goods of his church or by ruling over its spiritual things. As
outward head he is a person that superintends persons inferior
to his nature, but he is called the head to those outside ot*
this number whom he rules by his influence in virtue of his
nature. And so Christ is the outward head of every par-
ticular church and of the universal church by virtue of his
divinity, and he is the inward head of the universal church by
virtue of his humanity; and these two natures, divinity and
humanity, are one Christ, who is the only head of his bride,
the universal church, and this is the totality of the predesti-
nate. For this divinity is the man who descended from
heaven and who ascended again into heaven, as is said in John
3 : 13, not the whole of the divinity considered as divinity,
but according to the headship whose descent was not a local
movement but an incarnation or sels-emptying. And the as-
cent was a local movement by which he took with himself
the other parts of the body.

Hence, it is plain that there is nothing inconsistent in a
