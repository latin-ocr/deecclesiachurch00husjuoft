 

SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT 279

But, alas, this threefold suspension men do not think of,
and especially ought those higher in worldly rank often re-
volve in their minds the way in which they may be sus-
pended from office and from benefice forever. Hence, on
the words, “The Lord in his anger said to Moses, Take all
the chiefs of the people and hang them up before the sun
on the gallows,'' Num. 25 : 4, Origen, Hom. 20, speaks thus:
“The Lord said unto Moses that he should take all the chiefs
and hang them up to the Lord before the sun. The people
sin and the chiefs are hung up before the sun, that is, they
are brought forward that they may be examined, and may
be convicted by the light. Thou seest what was the con-
dition of the chiefs of the people. Not only were they con-
victed for their own transgressions but they were also obliged
to give a reason for the sins of the people lest perhaps the
guilt was theirs that the people came short, and lest per-
haps they had not taught nor moved nor been solicitous
to convict those who were first in the guilt that the conta-
gion might not be spread among many. For the leaders and
doctors ought to do all these things, for, if they do not and
have no concern for the common people, the people sin,
and they themselves are held up and brought forth to receive
sentence. Moses, that is, God’s law, convicts them as neg-
lectful and indolent, and the wrath of God is turned against
them and withdrawn from the people. If men would think
of these things, they would never desire the chiefs of the
people or go to them. For it is sufficient for me, if I am con-
victed of my own sins and shortcomings, it is sufficient for me
to render a reason for my own self and for my own sins.
Why is it necessary for me also to be held up for the people's
sins before the sun, in the face of which nothing can be hid·
den or kept dark or veiled ?'' And Origen adds, “the chiefs
are held up before the sun and, if guilt is found in them, God's
anger ceases towards the people.'' So much Origen, who
shows how chiefs are heavily censured for the sin of self-in-
dulgence which the people practise.
