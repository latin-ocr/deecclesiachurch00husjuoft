82 THE CHURCH

other hand, St. Dionysius‚¹ de divinis nominibus, 3, calls St.
Peter the peak, that is, the capital or captain. And in his
book which he wrote on the death of the apostles Peter and
Paul, he thus addresses Titus: “As Peter and Paul were
being led to the place of martyrdom and were about to be
separated, one from the other, Paul addressed to Peter these
words: ‘Peace be to thee, O foundation of the churches and
shepherd of Christ⁷s sheep and lambs !’'' In the same way
Augustine‚ in his Questions on the Old and New Low, says
that “Peter was the first among the apostles.'' So likewise
Pope Marcellus, 24 : 1, Rogamus [Friedberg‚ 1 : 970]‚2 says:
“We beseech you, brethren, that ye teach no otherwise than
as ye have received from St. Peter and the other apostles,
for he is the head of the whole church, to whom the Lord
said: ‘Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my
church. ' '⁷ Likewise Pope Anacletus, Dist. 21,3 in novo [Fried-
berg, 1 ε 69]; “In the New Testament after Christ's death,
the priestly order began with Peter, because to him as the
first was given the pontificate in Christ's church even as the
Lord said to him: ‘Thou art Peter and upon this rock Ι will
build my church.' He, therefore, was the first to receive
from the Lord the power of binding and loosing and he was
the first to lead the people to the saith by the power of his
preaching. And truly the other apostles received with him
in virtue of equal fellowship honor and power.'' Likewise,
it is commonly said that Peter was the head of the church
because he was called Cephas, which by interpretation is head.

¹ Dionysius the Areopagite‚ once identified with St. Denis and regarded
as first bishop of Athens, wrote probably about 500, as he is first quoted 533,
and shows the influence of Alexandrian neo-Platonism. He was much quoted
in the Middle Ages and has a strong mystical vein. His Eccles. H ierarclzy and
his H eavenly H ierarchy were issued by John Colet and reissued by Lupton with
trsl.‚ London, 1869.

²Marcellus, pope, 308-309. The quotation is from Pseudo-Isidore.

³ Anacletus, 79?-91?‚ placed by the Catholics in the list of popes second
after Peter. Linus, Anacletus, Clement were probably contemporary presby-
ters in Rome, as Lipsius says. This quotation is from Pseudo-Isidore. Thirty
quotations are ascribed to Anacletus in the Corp. jur. can.
