14 THE CHURCH

Hence, it is evident that the universal holy church is
Christ’s one and only bride, the virgin to be in the end most
chaste, whom the Son oi God bound to himself in matrimony
out of eternal love and by the grace of adoption, and the
church we firmly believe, saying with the Creed, “1 believe
one holy catholic church,'' and about which the word is
added in the second Creed, “ and apostolic [church].’' It is
called apostolic for the reason that the apostles are full par-
ticipants of this same mother church, which is fully purified
in the Spirit‚ and which they themselves planted with the
teaching and blood oi Christ; and by whose teaching (i. 6., of
the apostles) and authority their vicars now rule the young
bride, who seeks only the bridegroom of the church. So runs
the Decretal 24 [Friedberg‚ 1 : 968] where pope Leo says:
“Peter's authority has its seat wherever its just sentence is
carried.'' For Peter himself dwells in heaven, seeing and
looking after what God binds and looses. Hence Boniface
VIII, Extravagante‚ says: “We are bound with living saith to
believe and hold that the holy catholic and apostolic church
is one.” ¹

The unity of the catholic church consists in the unity
of predestination‚ inasmuch as her separate members are one
by predestination² and in the unity of blessedness, and in-
asmuch as her separate sons are finally united in bliss. For,
in the present time, her unity consists in the unity of saith
and the Christian virtues and in the unity of love, even as

¹ Boniface's famous bull, Unam sanctam, issued 1302 against Philip the Fair
of F rance, which commands subjection to the Roman pontifi as the condition
of salvation for every creature. The text goes on, “and we firmly believe it
and sincerely confess that outside of it there is no salvation or remissxon of
sins, as the bridegroom announced in the Canticles: ‘My bride is one.”'
See Schaff, Ch. H ist„ V, part 2 ε 25 sqq. for the original and translation; F ried-
berg‚ 2 : 12453 Mirbt‚ 162. In this treatise Huss quotes this bull a number oi
times, even to the last chapter.

²² In his Reply to Palecz, Mon„ 1 . 321, Huss says again: “The grace of pre-
destination is the chain by which the body of the church and every member of
it are joined to Christ.'' He also speaks oi the unity through love, saith, and
hope, Mon„ 1 : 326.
