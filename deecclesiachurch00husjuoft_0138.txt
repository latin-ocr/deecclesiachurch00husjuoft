84 THE CHURCH

it is sufficient for me that I am the bridegroom’s friend
that standeth and heareth with joy¹ the bridegroom's voice,‘'
John 3 : 27—29. And the bridegroom said: “Ye are my
friends if ye do whatsoever I command you‚⁷' John 15 z 14.
Thus it is evident that it would be the highest arrogance
and folly for any man, Christ excepted, to call himself the
head and the bridegroom of the holy catholic church.

But the reason for Christ's appointing Peter after himself
as captain and shepherd was the pre-eminence of virtues fit-
ting him to rule the church. For otherwise the Wisdom² of
the Father would have unwisely appointed him the bishop
of his church. And as all moral virtues are bound together
in a class—in genere—it is evident that Peter had a certain
pre-eminence in the entire class of virtues. But there were
three virtues in which Peter excelled, namely‚ faith, humil-
ity, and love. F aith, which properly is the foundation of
the church, excelled in Peter because of what the best of
Masters ordained‚ Matt. 16 : 16, in answer to that question
which he asked about himself: “Whom do men say that I
the Son of man am?'' To this Peter replied for all, saying:
“Thou art the Son of the living God.'' Here he confessed
Christ’s humanity by which he meant that Christ was the
Messiah promised to the fathers. The second part confesses
Christ as the natural Son of the living God, and so Peter
confessed Christ to be very God and very man. And among
all the articles of saith, this one appertains most to the edi-
fication of the church‚ for, according to St. John, the Son of
God overcometh the world: “Who is he that overcometh
the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of
God?'' I John 5 : 5. For, when this foundation is laid, the
belief follows that all things which Christ did or taught are
to be accepted without any detraction by the whole church.

son of the Trinity by the old commentators.
