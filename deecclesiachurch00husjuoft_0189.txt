THE POPE NOT THE CHURCH'S HEAD 135

Therefore, after Augustine has shown that a truly Chris-
tian wife ought to mourn over the fornication of her hus-
band, not for carnal reasons, but out of love and for the
chastity due to the man Christ—he says consequentially
that Christ speaks in the hearts of good women, where the
husband does not hear, and he goes on to say: “Mourn over
the injuries done by thy husband, but do not imitate them
that he may rather imitate you in that which is good. For
in that wherein he does wrong, do not regard him as thy
head but me, thy Lord.'' And he proves that this ought to

does wrong and the body follow its head, they both go over

Christ is a bodily person, because the man who is the head
of the church militant, who is Christ, is present through all
time with his church unto the consummation of the age, in
virtue of his divine personality. Similarly, he is present by
grace, giving his body to the church to be eaten in a sacra-
mental and spiritual way. Wherefore‚ is not that bridegroom,
