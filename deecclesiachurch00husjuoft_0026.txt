was called the evangelica] clergy—clerus evangelicus.²

In repeated discussions, Huss made the clear distinction
between apostolic commands‚ as contained in the Scriptures‚
and papal mandates. No bidding is obligatory which isjnot
distinctly based on the Scripture—praeter expressam scrip-
turam—and, where usage and Scripture disagree‚ usage is to

penalty for heresy. He calls it the “sanguinary corollary.''
In repudiating it, Chapter XVI, he was setting himself against
Innocent III and the great pontiffs who came after him and

putting of dissenters out oi the world. They were likened
to scabby sheep and to the locusts of Joel hidden in the
dust. Heresy was a cancer to be cut out by the extermina-
