254 THE CHURCH

ished together by the sword. And others, exposing their
necks for the truth have been martyred, being seized, im-
prisoned, and murdered and yet did not deny Christ's truth
—priests, and also laymen and women. But those who have
oppressed them have gone away clandestinely for, terrified
by antichrist's censures and seizures, they have turned into
the opposite way. But God, up to this time, multiplies
the sons of his church who suffer and are patient and pub-
lish the truth of Christ's law. Therefore, blessed be God
and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has hidden the
way of truth from the wise and prudent and revealed it unto
simple laymen and little priests who choose rather to obey
God than men, who in acts generically good and acts neu-
tral have the life of Christ before their eyes and obey prel-
ates so far as these acts, modified by circumstances, can be
reasonably put into practice for edification through the imi-

order to be virtuous, must be justified by eight circumstances,
which are set forth in this line:

generically or neutral to obey, and not so in another place
or in any place whatsoever. How much, namely‚ he ought
to obey, in as far as the command is of something applicable
to edification according to the counsel of Jesus Christ or his
command. For one is not bound to obey forever his per-

once out of sight, the men were taken from prison and quickly beheaded. A
great crowd coming together gathered up the bodies and carried them amidst
the singing of sacred hymns to Bethlehem chapel‚ where they were buried and
looked upon as martyrs. In one of his sermons, Langsdorff, p. 16, Huss refers
to the death of these three men as a price for denying that the pope is the God
of this world and can forgive sins as he will, and to their burial in Bethlehem.
