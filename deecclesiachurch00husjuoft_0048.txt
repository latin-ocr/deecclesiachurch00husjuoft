xlii IN TRODUCT ION

furt text, it is fair to presume that the manuscript would show
no change in any essential matter. It is to be hoped that Dr.
Flajshans will add to his other editions of Huss's writings a
new edition of this, Huss's most important treatise.

Huss’s Treatise on the Church is now within the reach
of readers who have known it chiefly by its fame. Its pages
will enable him who reads to feel some of the pious and heroic
spirit os its author, the preacher of Bethlehem chapel, and
at the same time to appreciate more fully what was the
doctrinal and hierarchical system handed down from the
classic period of the Middle Ages to the age of Wyclif and
Huss. According to the letter of this system these two men
were justly pronounced heretics, but not according to the
Scriptures to which they appealed.1

To follow Huss's own presentation, the principle upon
which Christ was put to death was stated in the words,
“ We have a law and by that law he ought to die.'' On
the same principle of ecclesiastical usage Huss suffered at
the stake at Constance. When the two principles empha-
sized in this treatise are given proper recognition—personal
devotion to Christ and a daily life conformed to his teach-
ings and example—the practice of Christian tolerance and all
human tolerance will be advanced. Then will creedal union
and ritualistic prepossessions be sostened and the barriers
of denominational sels-sufficiency be broken down, barriers
which, at least in part, have been erected on metaphysical
definitions in theological matters or uncertain assumptions
drawn from history concerning the ministry and the sacra-
ments, for which no distinct warrant can be found in the
pages of the New Testament. This treatise will have a
mission to-day, if its pages promote the idea that devotion
to Christ is the condition and the surety of Christian fellow-
ship and co-operation.

¹This treatise quotes the New Testament at least 347 times and the Old
Testament 72 times. The two books most frequently quoted are the Gospels
oi Matthew‚ 93 times; and John, 67 times.
