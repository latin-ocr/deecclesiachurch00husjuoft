FAITH 69

which the church of Christ practises. Likewise it is to be
noted that, inasmuch as saith is not of things which appear
to the senses but of hidden things and inasmuch as it is dif-
ficult to believe hidden things, therefore two elements are
necessary to faith in order that we may believe anything
truly: (1) the truth which illumines the mind, (2) the author-
ity [evidence] which confirms the mind. Here belongs one
property of saith, that it is concerned alone with the truth—all
falsehood being excluded—the truth which the faithful ought
to defend even unto death. The second property of saith is,
that without proof and special knowledge it is obscure to the
faithful, for what we see with the eye we cannot be said to
believeaeAnd the saints in heaven who see the articles clearly,
which we know obscurely, are not said to believe them but
to see. In the place of faith they have clear vision and in the
place of hope unending fruition. The third property of saith
is, that it is the foundation [assurance] of the things which
are to be believed for the pilgrim who is to come to the peaceful
dwelling. Therefore‚ the apostle says that saith is “the sub-
stance,’' that is, the foundation, “of things hoped for'': “the
evidence of things which do not appear‚'' that is, to the senses,
Heb. 11 : 1. For now we hope for our blessedness and believe,
but do not see with the eyes of the fiesh. And, because it is
not possible without saith to please God, therefore every one
who is to be saved ought first of all to be faithful—fidelis*
[have faith]. A faithful person, however, is he who has faith
infused by God and has no fear of ill to himself mixed with
his saith. But all open offenders according to the law of
present unrighteousness are uniaithful—infideles—[without
faith]‚ for it is impossible for any one to sin mortal sin except

stantia rerum, that which underlies, and trsl. “assurance’' in the Rev. Vers.
The same word substantia is used in the Vulgate, II Cor. 9 : 4, 11 : 17; Heb.
3 : 14. Huss may also have been influenced by the Vulgate fundamentum,
Heb. 6 : 1, “not laying the foundation of repentance and good works and of
saith toward God.” Huss quotes Heb. 11 : 1 in his Com. on Peter the Lombard,
