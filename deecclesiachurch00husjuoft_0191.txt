CHAPTER XIV

WHEN THE CARDINALS ARE THE TRUE
SUCCESSORS OF THE APOSTLES

Tm: second point is this: the college of cardinals is the
body of the holy Roman church. This being so, then the
college of the cardinals is the holy Roman church. The
conclusion follows from Eph. 1 ε 22: “He gave him to be
head over the whole church, which is his body.'' And as the
church, which is Christ’s mystical body, cannot be damned,
as when Christ said, “on this rock Ι will bujld my church
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it''—it follows,
that the college of cardinals cannot be damned3 and since
this conclusion is false or, at least, for the doctors doubtful,
it follows that in this particular point they have laid down
as truth what is doctrinally false or doubtful. What is the
fruit of teaching the worshippers of Christ in this way?

Likewise‚ the college of cardinals is either the true body
of the holy Roman church or the pretended body. Not the
second, according to the doctors. Therefore they must be
the true body, and consequently that college is predestinated
unto glory, and, as the doctors have not the revelation of
predestination with reference to that college, it follows, that
they ought not to have affirmed that the college is the body
of the Roman church.

Again, the body of the holy Roman church is made up
of all the predestinate, and the college by itself does not in-
clude all these. The first part of this statement appears
from the words of the apostle, who spoke as the representa-
tive of the predestinate: “We being many are one body in
Christ‚'' Romans 12 ε 5. And, showing the um‘ty of the body,
