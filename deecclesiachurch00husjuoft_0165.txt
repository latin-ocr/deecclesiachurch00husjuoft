CHAPTER XI

THE ABUSE OF SCRIPTURE IN THE INTEREST OF
CLERICAL POWER

BECAUSE many priests abandon the imitation of Christ,
the high priest, and boast of the power committed to the
church‚ without doing works that correspond, therefore up
to this time we have been speaking of the power of this
kind. For they extract out of Matt. 18 : 16, “Whatsoever
thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,'' that
whatsoever they do, every man ought altogether to approve.
And from the words of Matt. 2 3 : 2, “The scribes and Phari-
sees sit on Moses' seat, therefore all things whatsoever they
bid you, these do‚” they extract that every inferior is to obey
them in all things. And so these priests clamorously apply
to themselves at their own pleasure whatsoever appeals to
them out of Christ’s Gospel, and without any ministry of
love on their part to correspond. But what plainly calls for
toil and worldly sels-abnegation and the imitation of Christ,
that they spurn away as something inapplicable to them-
selves, or make believe they hold it when they do not.

Hence, because Jesus said to Peter, “I will give unto thee
the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt
bind on earth, etc.‚'' this they lay hold of with great compla-
cency for the exaltation of their own power. But what the
Lord said to Peter, John 21 ε 17, “Follow me and seed my
sheep,'' this they fiee from as poison. Likewise‚ what he
said to his disciples, Matt. 18 : 18, “What things soever ye
shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,'' they grate-
fully seize upon and glory in. But what he says, Matt.
