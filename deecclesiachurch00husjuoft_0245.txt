HUSS’S RESISTANCE TO THE POPE 191

Glossa ordinaria also agrees in its comment on the words:
“the powers that be are ordained of God'’ [Romans 13 : 1].
The Master of Sentences also agrees, 2 : 44 [Migne's ed.‚ p.
246].

Perfect obedience is that whereby the person obeying
places all his willing and not willing—velle et nolle—in the
will of his prelate, to do the acts commanded, so long as the
command does not gainsay the divine will or good morals
or the necessities of life, and so long as it does not conflict
with the commands and counsels of the Lord Jesus Christ.
And because obedience appertains to commands and coun-
sels, the difference is to be noted between a command and an
evangelical counsel, so far as they may be distinguished as
opposites.¹

A precept or command is a general teaching of God, obli-
gating every man under pain of mortal sin—namely, in cases
in which he has fallen away from the command. Hence the
saints who for a period of their life lived hypocritically sinned
mortally for that period. So also the damned, by persist-
ent false living sin persistently in hell.

A counsel is a special teaching of God, obligating under
pain only of venial sin and for the period of this life. And
so the doctors say that precepts are for the imperfect, ob-
ligating them for the reason that they are servants. But

¹ Huss is making the distinction between the mandates of the Scripturas—
praecepta—such as the duties enjoined by the Ten Commandments and the
evangelical counsels or counsels of pei-fection, evangelica consilia. He takes
it up in his Com. on the Lombard, pp. 482, 488 sqq. The counsels are voluntary
poverty‚ voluntary chastity and absolute obedience to the earthly ecclesias-
tical superior, as to an abbot or a bishop. Origen made the distinction in the
third century and based it on two kinds of morality. The mandates are for all
Christians and must be kept in order to salvation; the counsels of perfectiori
for the higher Christians or saints. By observing the counsels of perfection one
secures a higher grade of merit and a higher place in heaven. I Cor. 7 : 25
and Christ's words to the rich man are taken to iustify the distinction. The
Protestant Reformers set it aside as unscriptural and tending to place those
who take the three vows above all ordinary mortals who follow Christ in the
usual daily avocations of life. Thomas Aquinas sets it forth at length, Summa,
1 ε 2 sq., 108 sqq. [Migne's ed„ 2 ε 894 sqq.].
