156 THE CHURCH

Pope Gregory XII, as a heretic,¹ these were and now are
true successors of the apostles, and these are other persons
than the pope and cardinals. Hence the sixth point is false.
The consequence follows together with the part spoken of
above. And the doctors did not dare to deny the first part.
Likewise, it should be evangelical wisdom that all priests
are consecrated and guided directly by the one and only
pontiff, our Lord Jesus Christ. For this was so at the time
of the apostles, when the church grew, and this statement
accords with Scripture. Therefore, God is able to bring his
church back to its pristine state by taking away the govern-
ment from the pope and cardinals. And so it stands that
others besides these may be vicars of the apostles.
Likewise the designation of the power and the office,
“minister of the church‚'' is indicated lest he wander away,
into forbidden ground, but no other one is indicated save
the one whom Christ appointed. For, since Christ is al-
mighty, omniscient, and all-merciful, it is clear that reason
requires that he ordain finally and unchangeably‚ and more
especially in view of the fact that in the primitive church
the harvest was larger, and God ordained more copiously dif-
ferent kinds of ministers as laborers in the harvest. But
then he only ordained deacons and presbyters and the pres-
byter and the bishop was the same person, as says Jerome
and as appears from Paul’s epistles to Timothy and Titus.
From these Jerome draws the conclusion in his letter to the

¹Gregory XII, Angelo Correr, fourth and last pope of the Roman line,
1406-1415‚ and contemporary with Benedict XIII, of the Avignon line, was
together with Benedict deposed as a schismatic and heretic by the council
of Pisa, June, 1409. He still claimed to be pope till 1415, when he resigned
his office to the council of Constance. He died 1417. Bohemia was true to
the Roman obedience till King Wenzel acknowledged the council of Pisa and
the pope it elected, Alexander V. Gregory and his two predecessors had seemed
to favor Wenzel's rival for the imperial crown—Ruprecht. The archbishop
of Prague, Zbynek, continued to acknowledge Gregory until the fall of 1409,
and Huss's alleged indorsement of Wenzel's action and acknowledgrnent of
Alexander was one of the immediate causes of the archbishop's strained rela-
tions with Huss.
