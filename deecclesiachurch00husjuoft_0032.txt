, did a man owe more to mortal teacher than Huss did to John
Wyclif.¹. In the fundamental doctrines concerning ‚the pre·
destinate, the church‚ the papacy, the power of the keys
and the authority of the Bible Huss agrees exactly with his
predecessor.² They are one in their denunciation of Boniface
VIII’s bun, Unam sanctam, and of Constantine’s donation.
All the reformatory-—and we may say revolutionary—
principles affirrned by the former will be found in Wyclif.

However‚ Huss was not a servile imitator of Wyclif and
it seems never to have occurred to his opponents in Prague
to twit him on the use he made of Wyclif’s writingS. It

must be borne in mind, that from no other source outside ’

the pages of Scripture could Huss have learned what he came
v to believe as from the pages of Wyclif. Reading him was
like taking clear water from a vessel filled at a spring re-
discovered. And, it must be remembered, that Huss had no
sooner left the university than he found himself in an⁴
atmosphere charged with the controversial spirit, himself
the chief figure.

To these considerations the following must also be taken
into account. Instead of transferring to his pages paragraphs
‘ from Wyclif bodily, Huss might easily have introduced into
them words of his own or taken the meaning and re-expressed
it in his own language. That he did not pursue* this method
is evidence that he had no intention of using the garments
of his great teacher to make a reputation for himself. He
was ready to die for his convictions and in this treatise the
chief consideration was to give the most forcible expression
possible to the views he and Wyclif wereknown to hold in

Ἀ succinet and authoritative statement of the extent to which Wyclif’s
writings were put into print before 1883 may be found in Loserth's thorough
article on‘Wyclif in the German Herzog, 21 ε 225 sq. With that year the
printing of the Latin writings was begun. The Trialogus, however, ‚which
gives Wyclif's distinctive views was published in Basel, 15²5· The English
writings had been gathered by two editors, Thomas Arnold, 1869-71, 3 vols„

and F. D. Mathew, 1880, 1 vol.
