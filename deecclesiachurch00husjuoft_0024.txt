call upon the Lord for indulgence which he could not himself
grant.

In his C ommentary on the Sentences os the Lombard Huss
presents substantially the same view that he presents in this
treatise and the cognate writings, but not so boldly. There,
he says, no one can be excommunicated unless he is first
excommunicated by himself and except he offends against
Christ's law.1 In his treatise on The Six Errors‚ Huss quotes
Peter the Lombard to show that the remission by a priest is
a different thing from remission by God who remits of Him-
sels, purifying the soul of guilt and loosing it from the debt
of eternal death. Did the pope possess the power of the
keys in the way generally supposed, as a thing of his own,
then he might empty purgatory itself, and, if he neglected
to do so, he would be guilty of ill-will or indifference. On
the question of absolution Huss is most emphatic, and he
restates his views again and again. No saint, he says, could
be found who had the presumption to say: “I have forgiven
thee thy sins,'' or “1 have absolved thee.’'² With Wyclif‚
and upon the basis of the Lord’s Prayer, Huss said that in a
real sense every Christian has the right to absolve.

The two keys which are put into the hands of the church
are knowledge and authority. The chief power given to the
Apostles and their successors was to preach or evangelize.
No prelatic authority has the right to inhibit one ordained
from preaching the Gospel any more than it has the right
to prohibit the giving of alms. As for the use of the prerog-
ative to censure, Huss insisted that it should be exercised
sparingly. Christ did not call down fire from heaven on the

² Pp. 103, 106, also Mon„ 1 : 229, 232, 239, etc. Wyclif declared that un-
J‘ust excommunication was worse than the murder of the body, de Eccles., p. 153.
In the course of his treatment of this subJ'ect‚ Huss gives an exposition of Jer.
1 ι 10, the famous passage which Gregory VII was wont to use for the suprem-

acy of the papal power over the civil. Ad octo doctores, Mon., 1 : 391. In
this treatise Huss elaborated at greatest length the subject of the keys, M on.,
