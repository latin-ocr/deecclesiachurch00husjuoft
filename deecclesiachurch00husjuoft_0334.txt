280 THE CHURCH

Woe, therefore, to the modern spiritual and secular princes
who themselves practise seli-indulgence, who give to their sub-
jects a bad example and do not reprove them or, if they re-
prove them, do this out of avarice! Such, without doubt, are
suspended from office by God, for it is written in the papal
law, Decretals, 3, de vita et honestate [Friedberg, 2 :455]:¹
“We command your brotherhood that, as far as the clerics
of your² jurisdiction are concerned, who are in the subdiac-
onate or the orders above it, if they have mistresses, ye
should studiously take care to admonish them that they re-
move from themselves these women who least of all ought
to have been admitted. But, if they refuse to acquiesce, ye
shall suspend them from their ecclesiastical benefices until
they make condign satisfaction, and if they who are sus-
pended presume to keep these women, ye shall see to it that
ye remove them permanently from those benefices.'' Be-
cause there is no defect in the law but in the superiors who
ought to practise it, therefore, the pope in the preceding
chapter says that prelates who may presume to hold on in
their iniquities to such persons, especially ior the sake oi
getting money or some other temporal good, them we wish
to subject to the same punishment. And it is said by the
authority of St. Gregory, Dist. 83 [Friedberg, 1 : 293]: “If
any bishop shall assent to the fornication of clerics for a
price or at their petitions and not assail their authority, he
ought to be suspended from his office.''³ And this suspen-

¹The heading of the chapter in the Decretals is: “The cohabitation of
clerics with women.” The quotation is from Alexander III's letter to the arch-
bishop of Canterbury. A part of the letter, not quoted by Huss, speaks “ oi the
depraved and detestable custom which had prevailed in England for a long
time, oi clerics having mistresses in their houses.'’ William the Conqueror did
not enforce celibacy and a council at Winchester, 1076, allowed priests already
married to retain their wives, prohibiting marriages thereafter. Councils under
Anselm, 1102, 1108, ordered priests to dismiss their concubines, but Eadmer,
Anselm's biographer, declares that few priests observed the chastity Anselm
called for, and Pascal ΙΙ, writing to Anselm, said most of the English priests
were married. In Bohemia the law of celibacy was also late of enforcement.
