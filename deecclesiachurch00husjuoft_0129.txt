THE CHURCH FOUNDED ΟΝ CHRIST 75

Christ spoke in the Gospel to St. Peter: “Thou art Peter,
and upon this Rock Ι will build my church.'' On these words
St. Augustine says, in his Sermons on tlze W ords os the Lord, 13
[Nic. Fatlzers, 6 z 34o]: “Our Lord Jesus Christ thus spake
to Peter, Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my
church—on this Rock, which thou hast confessed, on this Rock
which thou hast recognized, when thou saidst, ‘Thou art
Christ, the Son of the living God'—‘I will build my church':
I will build thee upon myself, not myself upon thee. For
wishing that men should be built upon men, they were saying,
‘I am of Paul, I of Apollos, and I of Cephas,' that is, Peter.
And others who did not wish to be built upon Peter—Petrum—
but upon the Rock—Petram—-said, ‘I am of Christ! '’ Again,
in his last Homily on John [Nic. Fathers, 7 ε 45o], Augustine
says: “Peter the apostle, because of the primacy of his apos-
tleship‚ had a symbolic and representative personality, for
what belonged to him as an individua] was that by nature
he was one man, by grace one Christian, and by a more
abundant grace he was one and the same chief apostle. But
when it was said to him: ‘I will give unto thee the keys of
the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on
earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt
loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven,' he represented the
universal church which in this world is shaken by divers
temptations, even as by torrents of rain, by rivers, and tem-
pests, and yet doth not fall, because it is founded upon the
Rock, the word from which Peter got his name. For Rock
—Petra—does not come from Peter—Petrus—but Peter from
Rock, just as the word Christ is not derived from Christian,
but Christian from Christ.

“Hence the Lord said: ‘On this Rock Ι will build my
church,' because Peter had said before, ‘Thou art the Christ,
the Son of the living God.' Upon this Rock which thou hast
confessed, he said, ‘I will build my church.' For Christ was
the Rock. Therefore, the church, which is founded on Christ,
