184 THE CHURCH

thy father—understand, not bodily father, but spiritual—
thou hast lost all virtues. Therefore obedience is worth
more than all the other moral virtues.''’

By the combination of the above sayings the doctors
mix up the false with the true, flattery with sear, and these
three things are involved in these words: “Certain of the
clergy''——here having in mind our party—“refuse to agree
to this, endeavoring as much as in them lies to lead the faith-
ful people to disobedience.'' See what a false lie this is, by
which they indicate that we are become seducers of the
people‚ when it is (1) not the purpose of our side to seduce the
people from real obedience, but that the people may be one,
governed harmoniously by the law of Christ. (2) The pur-
pose of our side is that the rules of antichrist shall not
seduce or separate the people from Christ, but that the law
of Christ shall honestly rule in connection with the customs
of the people so far as they are approved by God's law. (3)
The purpose of our side is that the clergy live honestly ac-
cording to the doctrine of Jesus Christ, laying aside pomp,
avarice and luxury. (4) Our side wishes and preaches that
the church militant, in its different parts which God has
ordained, be honestly commingled, namely, of Christ's priests
those who administer his law in purity, and from the world
the nobles who press for the observance of the ordinances of
Christ and the common people‚ both these parts serving in
accordance with Christ's law. Therefore, let the doctors be-
stow this wrong on our side. But the flattery which they
show to prelates and the fear with which they would affright
our side are involved in the words: “endeavouring to lead
the faithful people to disobedience towards prelates, and ir-
reverence towards the papal‚ episcopal, sacerdotal and cler-
ical dignities.'’ Blessed be Christ Jesus that they have not
dared to lay on us the calumny of disobedience to Jesus
Christ—or perhaps they have forgotten to do so, for to serve
him is to reign, and obedience rendered to him avails so much
