THE ABUSE OF SCRIPTURE 113

from this they draw the inference that it is lawful for them
to do whatsoever they please, and so, by reasoning of the
same kind, they are most blessed fathers together with Christ
in pronouncing judgment in the church and because they are

to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and there
was given to him authority over every tribe and people and
every tongue and nation3 and all that dwell on the earth
shall worship him, every one whose name hath not been writ-
ten in the book of life and of the Lamb,1 that hath been
slain.'' Who is this beast whom men worship out of fear of
his power? He who reads let him understand and resist as-
sumed power of this kind and let him not fear, as they did,
because it was given to that beast to make war against the
