THE POPE NOT THE CHURCH'S HEAD 133

church is the bride of Christ built upon Christ “against
which the gates of hell cannot prevail,'' we must argue thus:
No pope is the most exalted person of the catholic church
but Christ himself ; therefore no pope is the head of the cath-
olic church besides Christ. The conclusion is valid reason-
ing from description to the thing described. Inasmuch as
the head of the church is the capital or chief person of the
church, yea, inasmuch as the head is a name of dignity and
of office—dignity in view of predestination‚ and office in view
of the administration of the whole church—it follows that no
one may reasonably assert of himself or of another without
revelation that he is the head of a particular holy church,
although if he live well he ought to hope that he is a member
of the holy catholic church, the bride of Christ. Therefore‚
we should not contend in regard to the reality of the in-
cumbency whether any one, whoever he may be, living with
us is the head of a particular holy church but, on the ground
of his works‚ we ought assume that, if he is a superior, ruling
over a particular holy church, then he is the superior in that
particular church, and this ought to be assumed of the
Roman pontifi, unless his works gainsay it, for the Saviour
said: “Beware of false prophets which come unto you in
sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves. By
their fruits ye shall know them‚'' Matt. 7:15. Also John
10 : 38: “Believe the works.’'

Likewise, it is not necessary to believe that every Roman
pontiff whatsoever is the head of any particular holy church
unless God has predestinated him. This is clear because
otherwise the Christian faith would be perverted and a
Christian would have to believe a lie. For the church was
deceived in the case of Agnes, and for the sake of His own,
and without doubt for the better, God permits that he who
is chosen pope should not forthwith and without reverent
hesitancy be regarded as holy or such as he assumes himself
to be. Hence Ι could wish that the doctors would openly
