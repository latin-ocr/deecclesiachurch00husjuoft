OBEDIENCE TO THE CHURCH 235

bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when
the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they
will fast. And no man puttethl a piece oi undressed cloth
upon an old garment, for that which would fill it up, taketh
from the garment and a worse rent is made. N either do men
put new wine into old wine-skins, or else the wine-skins burst
and the wine is spilt and the skins perish, but they put new
wine into new skins and both are preserved,’' Matt. 9 : 15—17.
Here the Saviour excuses his disciples for not tasting, first for
the reason that he, the bridegroom oi the church‚ was at that
time with his children and providing for them3 secondly, be-
cause that bodily fasting did not befit them for that time, as
Lyra says: “Wherefore does the bridegroom say, ‘Can the
children of the bridegroom mourn?' that is, be sad by afflict-
ing themselves with fasting ?—which is as if he should say, No,
for fasting does not befit them now, ‘but the days will come,'
namely, the days of the passion, ‘when the bridegroom will
be taken away from them' by death, and ‘then they will
fast,' that is, with the tasting of grief, as it is written: ‘Ye
shall weep and lament‚' John 16 ε 20. ‘Then shall they
fast,' namely, at a time when such fasting befits them. And
then by a double example the Saviour proves that bodily
fasting did not befit them at that time.'' Supplications are
also touched upon in Luke 5 ε 33, when they said: “Why
do the disciples of John fast often and make supplications,²
likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but thjne eat and
drink? And Jesus said unto them, Can ye make the sons
of the bridegroom fast when the bridegroom is with them?''
which is as much as to say, apart from the bridegroom's will
ye cannot lawfully make his sons to fast.

burden his disciples but, laying on them an easy yoke and
a light burden, says of the Pharisees and scribes, sitting in
