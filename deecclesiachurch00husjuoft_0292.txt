238 THE CHURCH

not God, as his spiritual Father‚ has lost all the virtues.''
And hence Augustine adds: “Therefore obedience profits
more than all the other moral virtues.'' Far-fetched, there-
fore, is the prooi of the doctors who seek to deduce from
this authority what they propose.

Further I lay down this conclusion and in spite of the
pretended—proe-tensa—excomrnunication, threatened or al-
ready issued, that the Christian ought to follow the com-
mandments of Christ. This appears from the conclusion of
St. Peter and the other apostles: “We must obey God rather
than men,'' Acts 5 : 29. From this it follows logically that
Christ's priest, who lives according to his law, and has a
knowledge of the Scripture and a desire to edify the people‚
ought to preach, a pretended excommunication to the con-
trary notwithstanding. This is clear, for to preach the Word
of God is a command to priests, as the apostle Peter bears
witness, when he says: “God charged us to preach unto the
people and to testify‚'' Acts 10:42. Jesus sent out the
twelve‚ commanding them and saying: “Go not into any
way of the gentiles . . . and as ye go, preach, saying‚ The
kingdom of heaven is at hand,'' Matt. 10 : 5-7. The same
appears from Luke, chapters 9 and 10, and also from what
Augustine says, Prologue to his Sermons: “Few are the priests
who rightly preach God’s Word, but many are they who
accursedly keep silence—some from ignorance, who refuse
to teach and some from neglect, because they spurn God's
Word3 but neither the former nor the latter may be ex-
cused from the guilt of keeping silence, since they ought not
to have a place of authority who do not know how to preach,
nor ought they to keep silent who know how to preach, how-
beit they are not in places of authority.'’

Likewise is this clear from what St. Jerome says on Ezek.
3 ε 18: “When I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die, and
thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked
from his wicked way to save his life, the same wicked man
