SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT 291

namely: “If the innocent are removed out of the church‚ and
the bodies of martyrs perish, it is not an injury but in pop-
ular speech it is said there has been homicide.'⁷ Likewise, the
Gloss says: “More grievously does he sin, by whose guilt a
boy's soul goes out of this lise without baptism, than he who

them from the church.''

But, alas! all such things as these the clergy, blinded by
wickedness‚ do not receive, who, on account of the non-pay-

7 : 26.

Jesus Christ Lord. And, when any one claims Christ for
himself, immediately with carping mouth and angry face they
say: Art thou the Christ? and after the manner of the Phar-

Hence, because Ι have preached Christ and his Gospel and
have uncovered antichrist, desiring that the clergy may live
in accord with Christ’s law, the prelates first arranged with
