200 THE CHURCH

of men’'—certainly vainglory! “For they make broad their
phylacteries'’ in bulls distributed throughout the whole world,
as if they were pre-eminent in keeping God’s law. Here
is hypocrisy. They enlarge the fringes with which they
cover their asses.¹ They love the chief places at feasts, seek-
ing pleasure and honor of men, and “the chief cathedras
—seats—in the synagogues,’' that is, accumulations of church
livings, for this one wants to be a cardinal, this one a patri-
arch, this one an archbishop. “And they love salutations
in the market-places,'' with genuflexions——that is, in public—
“and to be called of men, Rabbin'' [Matt. 23 :4 sqq.], that is,
our Master, and to rule the whole church of Christ.
Therefore, they also call the Roman curia the mistress
and teacher of churches. And granting the possibility of this,
these persons are seats not of Christ but of Satan, sitting
in view of their own life in the cathedra of pestilence. And
of this the Psalrnist, speaking of Christ, said: “Blessed is
the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the cathe-
dra of pestilence‚'' Psalm 1 ε 1. Here Augustine says [Com.
on Psalms, Nic. Fathers, 8 : 1]: “This is to be understood of
our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord-man, who does not sit in
the cathedra of pestilence. He did not desire an earthly
kingdom with its pride, which is rightly understood to be the
cathedra of pestilence, because there is hardly a single one
who is wanting in the love of dominion and does not hanker
after glory. The pestilence is a disease widely pervasive
and involving all 01· nearly all people. More amply‚ how-
ever, the cathedra stands for pernicious doctrine whose words
work as doth a cancer.'’ Thus much Augustine, who calls
the cathedra of pestilence the lust of dominion and perni-
cious doctrine, a cathedra in which the elders of the church
sit, wishing to exercise secular dominion and teaching men
to keep their doctrines more carefully than the command-

ments of God.
