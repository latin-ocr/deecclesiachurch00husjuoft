1 2 2 THE CHURCH

and prophet, beloved of God, who without doubt excelled
modern popes and notably Clement, who gave command to
the angels. He did not wish to give any command to an
angel but, falling down, wished to worship before his feet, and
the holy angel forbade him, showing him that he ought to
worship God.

But in view of Heb. 7 ε 23, “many indeed are made priests
according to the law,'' it is to be noted that every high priest
of the old law prefigured Christ in all his legal acts. There-
fore he is called, uniquely, the High Priest and Bishop of our
souls, and for this reason that multitude of priests and their
offices are fulfilled in Christ alone, as the apostle says in
Heb. 7 and 9. And this is the reason why the apostles did not
call themselves most holy popes, heads of the universal church,
or universal pontiffs; but, having with thern the High Priest
even unto the consummation of the age, they called them-
selves servants of Christ, his companions in tribulation and
ministers of the church. Hence this holy custom was ob-
served in the time of St. Gregory, Decretum, Dist. 92 [Fried-
berg‚ 1 : 318]; and in the preface of his letter [Nic. Fathers,
2d Ser., 12 : 241] Gregory says: “See how, so far as I arn
concerned, Ι forbade that thou shouldst use that word of
proud entitlement. Thou wert concerned to confer upon me
the title of universal pope which Ι beg thy most sweet holi-
ness not to do any more, for in this way would be taken
away from thee and shown to another more authority than
reason allows. I do not seek to be advanced with words—
[titles]—-but by my good life—moribus. Nor do Ι regard that
to be an honor wherein I would know that my brethren had
lost their honor. For mine is also the honor of the universal
church3 my honor is the solid stability of my brethren.
Then am Ι honored, when the honor due is not denied to
any single one of them, for if thy holiness entitles me uni-
versal pope, it denies that thou art this, because thy holiness
professes that I am the whole—universum. But sar be that
