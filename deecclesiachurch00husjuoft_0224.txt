1 70 THE CHURCH

learned than they was the thief, who, hanging on the cross,
bare witness to Christ, saying: “This man hath done nothing
amiss,'' Luke 23 : 41.

And, so far as the chief purpose of the doctors goes, who
intend that the pope ought to be the judge of all cases and
that whoso does not obey him ought to die the death of the
body, these doctors ought to be reverenced for their apish
and cruel comparison [that is, to those who put Christ to
death], especially as our Lord Jesus Christ, priest of both
Testaments, neither wished to pronounce civil judgment nor
to condemn the disobedient to bodily death. For, so far as
the first goes, he said: “Man‚ who made me a judge or di-
vider over you?'' Luke 12 : 14. And so far as the second,
he said to the woman taken in adultery, whom the Pharisees
pronounced worthy of death according to the law: “Neither
do I condemn thee; go thy way3 from henceforth sin no
more,'' John 8 : 11.

But, perhaps it may be said by the doctors that this is
not to the point, that the law says: “He who does presump-
tuously, not willing to obey the rule of the priest.'’ See, I
will give a case in form—for, Christ said: “If thy brother
sin against thee, go show him his fault between thee and him
alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother, but if
he hear thee not, take with thee one or two, that at the mouth
of two witnesses or three every word may be established;
and if he refuse to hear them, tell it to the church: and if
he refuse to hear the church let him be unto thee as the
gentile and the publican,'' Matt. 18 : 15-17. See, to whom
the supreme lord of the law and the supreme pontiff speaks?
Certainly to Peter, the future Roman pontiff, next after
himself, that he might kindly correct the erring and convince
the disobedient person before witnesses, and if he remained
hardened in disobedience he spoke to the church, that is, he
announced to the multitude, not to put to death the per-
verse and disobedient with corporal death, but to avoid him
