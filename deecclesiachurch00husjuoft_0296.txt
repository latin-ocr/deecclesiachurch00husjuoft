242 THE CHURCH

reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teach-
ing. For the time will corne, when they will not endure
sound doctrine, but having itching ears they will heap to
themselves teachers after their own lusts and will turn away
their ears from the truth and turn aside unto fables,'' II Tim.
4 : 1—4. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at that prel-
ates gratefully accept the statements of the aforesaid doc-
tors, for they anoint all those statements with the oil of
flattery and do not lay down a single word of correction with

namely‚ in deed. “But do not according to their works,''
that is, keep their doctrine, do not follow their life: “for
they say and do not.'' Chrysostom says: “They preach the
saith and act in unbelief, give to others peace and do not
have it themselves, cry out the truth and love a lie, denounce
avarice and love covetousness.'' Augustine‚ as above, on
Ex. 18, says: “Sitting in Moses' seat, they teach God's law;
