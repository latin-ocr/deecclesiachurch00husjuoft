SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT 283

doubtcdly rnore honorable than all material temples, which
will not last after the day of judgment. And woe is me, if
Ι keep silence, not assailing the avarice or the evident luxury
οἱ the clergy. For it is said, Dist. 83 [84, 85, Friedberg,
1 :292 sq.], an error not resisted is an error approved and
the truth‚ inasmuch as it is defended least, is oppressed. In-
deed, as one is able to convict1 perverse persons, to neglect to
do so is nothing else than to favor them. And there is not

aware who is chargeable with it.'’ These words of St. Gregory
are also found, Dist. 43, sit rector [Friedberg, 1 : 154].

Oh that our doctors would turn to these things, for then
they would not speak fair of the life of prelates and they
would not be slow to uncover to them their iniquity, that
they might provoke them to penitence. They would see in
