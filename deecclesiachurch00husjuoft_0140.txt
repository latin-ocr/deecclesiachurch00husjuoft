23 : 11; Mark 10 z 43—how should he not be of an humble
spirit, above others, in regard to the prerogative which he
had from the Lord Jesus Christ? Hence it is said with prob-
ability that Peter asked questions and answered questions
with humility just as he bore himself, above others, in hu-
mility to perform his ministry in the church. For, sent by
the apostles to Samaria, he went humbly with John, Acts
8 : 14. And s0‚ called to Joppa, he went humbly, and there
for many days he tarried with Simon the tanner. Called
by Cornelius from Joppa, he proceeded humbly to Caesarea,
Acts 10 : 18. And also at the council of the apostles and

service, as appears from the definition of the Master: “Whoso
humbleth himself shall be exalted,'' Matt. 23 ε 12.

As for the third virtue, love, it is plain that Peter had
this in certain respects above the others, as appears from the
fervor of his acts which fittingly proceed from greater love.
This is confirmed by the fact that otherwise he would have
been ungrateful, if he had not loved his Master, in a way
corresponding to Him who had loved him in so peculiar a
way, and wiped him clean from his great blasphemy and
graciously placed him over his sheep. Again it is confirmed
by this, that otherwise there would have been no fitness in the
