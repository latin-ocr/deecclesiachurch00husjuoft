ROMAN PONTIFF AND CARDINALS 59

quoted, when he said: “On this rock I will build my church.'’
And that he means this church is plain from the words which
follow: “And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.'’
For seeing that Christ is the rock of that church and also the
foundation on whom she is builded in respect to predestina-
tion‚ she cannot finally be overthrown by the gates of hell,
that is, by the power and the assaults of tyrants who per-
secute her or the assaults of wicked spirits. For mightier is
Christ the king of heaven, the bridegroom of the church,
than the prince of this world. Therefooe, in order to show his
power and foreknowledge and the predestination wherewith
he builds, protects‚ foreknows‚ and predestinates his church,
and to give persevering hope to his church, he added: “And
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.'' Here Lyra
says: “From this it appears that the church is not composed
of men by virtue of any power of ecclesiastical and secular
dignity‚ because there are many princes and high priests and
others of lower degree who have been found apostates from
the faith.'' This comment has its proof‚ in part, in the case of
Judas Iscariot, both apostle and bishop, who was present when
Christ said: “On this rock I will build my church and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against it.'’ But he himself
was not built upon the rock in respect of predestination and
therefore the gates of hell prevailed against him.

From the aforesaid words of Christ it is evident that the
church is taken to mean all, in a special sense, who after his
resurrection were to be built upon him and in him by faith
and perfecting grace. For Christ commended Peter, who
bore [represented] the person of the universal church and
coniessed his faith in the words: “Thou art the Christ, the
Son of the living God.'' And Christ said to him, “Blessed art
thou, Simon Bar-Jonah.'' This commendation befits Peter
and the whole church, which from the beginning was blessed
in the way, by confessing humbly, obediently, heartily, and
constantly that Christ is the Son of the living God. This
