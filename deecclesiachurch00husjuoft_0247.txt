tivity, lest by defect of pure purpose we fall into hypocrisy, of
which it is said: “Take heed that ye do not your alms to
be seen of men,'' Matt. 6 ε 1. Nor will there be any example
of coniorming one’s works to one's words such as Christ spoke
of: “The Pharisees say and do not‚” Matt. 23 : 3. And so he
counselled the hypocrite to “first cast out the bearn out of

Therefore, all pilgrims are obligated to keep these counsels
or some of thern, as occasion demands, on the pain of venial

lest he contemn a divine counsel.

And it is to be noted that the twelfth counsel, namely,
the rebuke of a brother, sometimes is a counsel when it con-
cerns venial offences, and sometimes a command when it
concerns the rebuke of mortal sins. And this second kind
of rebuke it belongs to every one to exercise, and it is al-
ways obligatory, but not on all occasions, for, as to place
