276 THE CHURCH

pleasure in you, neither will Ι accept an offering at thy hand‚'’
Mal. 1 : 10. And Christ's apostle suspended all who were
guilty of criminal offence from the ministry of Christ's body
and blood and the Lord, as he said: “Wherefore whoso shall
eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy
manner shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord‚'’
I Cor. 11 : 27. Likewise, we read of the severe suspension

rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord also hath rejected
thee from being king,'’ I Sam. 15 : 23.

It is plain how suspension varies, for one is a suspen-

good from which the sinner is justly suspended on account
of open sin. Likewise, there is a suspension in fact and a
suspension by law and there are other sorts of suspension.
But, as has been said, suspension by law belongs chiefly to
