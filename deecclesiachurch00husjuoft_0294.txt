240 THE CHURCH

Further‚ it is evident that is pope or other superior com-
mand the priest not to preach‚ who is disposed to do so
(as has been said), or the rich not to give alms, the inferior
ought not to obey. Wherefore‚ depending on this command
of the Lord, I have not obeyed Pope Alexander’s command
in regard to not preaching and hence will humbly bear ex-
communication‚¹ confident that I will secure to myself the
benediction of my God. And as to God, the Psalmist says:
“Let them be accursed, but do thou bless.'' And he also
blessed, when he said: “Blessed are ye when men shall re-
proach you and say all manner of evil against you falsely
for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is
your reward in heaven‚'' Matt. 5 ε 11, 12.

lThis was the papal bull of Dec. 20, 1409, which forbade preaching in
chapels which, like Bethlehem chapel, were not connected with a cathedral,
collegiate or conventual church or their cemeteries. Dec„ p. 375.
