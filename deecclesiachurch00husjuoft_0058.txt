4 THE CHURCH

holy catholic church is! And, in the same place and in a
similar way, he speaks of the church of the wicked. This, he
says, “brought forth Cain, Ham, Ishmael, and Esau, and also
Dathan and other like persons of that people. And she,
which brought forth these, also brought forth Judas, the false
apostles, Simon Magus, and other pseudo-Christians, down
to these days—all obstinately hardened in fleshly lusts,
whether they are mixed togetherl in a union or are clearly
distinguished the one from the other.'' So much, Augus-
tine.

From this statement it appears that the holy universal
church is one, the church which is the totality of the predes-
tinate, including all, from the first righteous man to the last
one to be saved in the future. And it includes all who are

by the Schoolmen ior the unity of the church. The Song of Solomon had a
great fascination for the Schoolmen—the book upon which, one after another,
they exercised their allegorical skill. It was regarded as an inspired anthology
of the bodily and spiritual excellences of the Virgin Mary‚ and the perfectioris
of the church. They found in it a storehouse of devotional meditatim, as did
Bernard, whose sermons on the Canticles are full of tropical effusions to Christ
and to Mary, and the chief source of his mystica} theology. Paschasius Rad-
bertus, de corpore el sanguine, Migne 120 ε 1²9 5, says, “The Canticles treat of
the holy church of God, which is called in the Canticles the paradise of de-
lights.'’ Damiani represented God as inflamed with love for Mary, singing
