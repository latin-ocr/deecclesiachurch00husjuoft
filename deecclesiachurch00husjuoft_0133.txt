THE CHURCH FOUNDED ΟΝ CHRIST 79

is founded in the very words of Scripture which says that
Christ is the Rock and the corner-stone and the effectual
foundation. But nowhere in Scripture do we expressly read
that Peter is a rock. Nor did Christ, who was able to say it
easily—leviter—say: “Thou art the Rock, and on thee, the
Rock, I will build my church.” What he said was: “Thou
art Peter,⁷' that is the confessor of the true Rock, “and
upon this Rock,'’ which thou hast confessed, “I will build
my church.” But Christ builds the church upon himself,
by saith, hope, and love. Hence we believe and hope in
Christ and not in Peter, and we are bound to have more
love and affection for Christ than for Peter. For the fathers
of the Old Testament did not believe or hope in Peter, who
was to come, but in the Rock. Nor did the saints of the
New Testament believe and hope in Peter but in Christ,
who is objectively [the object of] our saith and hope.

It must be granted that the apostles are foundations of
the church but not in the same way as Christ is the foun-
dation. For Christ is the foundation of foundations, as he
also is the holiest of the holy. This is expressed by St. Au-
gustine on Psalm 86 [N ic. Fathers, 8 z 420]: “His foundations
are in the mountains,'’ etc. Here he shows that the chief
foundation of the New Jerusalem, the city of Zion, and also
its corner-stone is Christ3 and the mountains are the proph-
ets and apostles in whom are the foundations of the church.
And Augustine says: “That ye may come to know that
Christ is the first and the great foundation, the apostle says,
‘other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid,
which is Christ Jesus.''' How, then, can the prophets and
the apostles be foundations and at the same time Christ
be the foundation beyond whom there is nothing? How do
we think but figuratively of the foundation of foundations,
except as he is expressly called the holiest of the holy? If,
therefore, thou thinkest of the sacramentS, Christ is the holi-
est of the holy; if thou thinkest of an obedient flock, Christ
