58 THE CHURCH

“on this rock I will build''; and in these the authority, “I
will give ωηο thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.’'
These four are to be touched upon briefly, namely, the church,
saith, the foundation, the church's power.

As for the first point, in view of the things set forth above
the proposition is to be laid down that, if we put aside the
church, nominally so called and as she is generally esteemed to
be, then the church is said to be threeiold. In one sense it is
the congregation or company of the faithful in respect to
what is for a time or in respect to present righteousness alone,
and in this sense the reprobate are of the church for the time
in which they are in grace. But this church is not Christ's
mystical body nor the holy catholic church nor any part of it.
In the second sense the church is taken to be the admixture
of the predestinate and the reprobate while they are in grace
in respect to present righteousness. And this church is in
part but not in whole identical with God’s holy church. And
this church is called mixed in character—grain and chaff,
wheat and tates—the kingdom of heaven like ωηο a net cast
into the sea and gathering fish of every kind and the king—
dom of heaven like ωηο ten virgins, of whom five were foolish
and five wise‚ as was said above. This church, Tychonius
falsely called the bipartite body of the Lord, as appears in de
doct. Christi, 3 : 32 [Nic. Fathers, 2 ε 5691. For the repro-
bate are not the body of the Lord or any part of it.

In the third sense the church is taken for the company
of the predestinate, whether they are in grace in respect to
present righteousness or not. In this sense the church is an
article of saith, about which the apostle was speaking when
he said, Eph. 5 : 26: “Christ loved the church and gave him-
self ior it, cleansing it by the washing of water in the word of
life, that he might present it to himself a glorious church not
having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it might be
holy and without spot.''

This church the Saviour calls his church in the Gospel
