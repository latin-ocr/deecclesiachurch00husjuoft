10 THE CHURCH

the Scriptures—the church of Christ, or the bride of God,
is truly called Christ's body, truly because the general church
of Christ is his body and Christ is called the head and all
the elect are called members. From these members the one
body of the church is brought unto a perfect man and the
measure of the fulness of Christ. But the body of Christ,
that is, the bride of God, is called in law the church. This
is according to the apostle's words: ‘And they twain shall be
one fiesh.' This, he says, is a great sacrament in Christ and
the church.² For, if Christ and the church are one flesh, then
certainly there is one body, one head, one bridegroom, but
different elect persons, members the one of the other.'' So
far, Paschasius.

These quotations from the saints show that the holy
catholic church is the number of all the predestinate2 and
Christ’s mystical body—Christ being himself the head—and
the bride of Christ, whom he of his great love redeemed with
his blood that he might at last possess her as glorious, not
having wrinkle of mortal sin or spot of venial sin, or anything
else defiling her, but that she might be holy and without spot,
perpetually embracing Christ, the bridegroom.

“Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood.’' Paschasius was a monk
and then. 844-8 51, abbot of the convent of Corbie, nearer Amiens. His tract
was written 831 and sent to Charles the Bald 844. His doctrine was opposed
by the monk Ratramnus, and others. The next controversy over the Lord’s
Supper was led by Berengar, d. 1088. Transubstantiation was made a dogma
of the church at the fourth Lateran council, 1215. Wyclif denied it, declaring
that transubstantiation would involve transaccidentation. Huss was also
charged with denying the doctrine, but emphatically repudiated the charge.
Ratramnus's work was put on the Index by the council of Trent.

¹ Eph. 5 ι 32. The false translation of Jerome, rendering the Greek word
mystery by sacrament, a rendering used to justify the inclusion of marriage
among the sacraments and repeated in the Rheims version.

²Wyclif‚ Congregatio omnium predestinatorum, solum numerus predestina-
torum, de Eccles„ 2, 5, etc. In his Com. on the Lombard, p. 36, Huss defines
the church as “the congregation of all the faithful about to be saved. It is the
mystica} body of Christ, that is now hidden to us, of which body the damned
do not really have part, but they are like dung which in the day of judgment
are to be separated from the body of Christ.''
