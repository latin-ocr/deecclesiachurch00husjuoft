ALL CHRISTIANS ARE NOT MEMBERS 17

break one of the least of these commandments and teach
men so, shall be least in the kingdom of heaven.'' Comment-
ing on both these passageS‚ Gregory, homily 12, says: “The
kingdom of heaven is the present church '' [Migne, 76 : 1119].
(5) The falsehood appears from Luke 3 ε 17: “He shall bap-
tize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire : whose san is in his
hand, and he will cleanse his threshing-floor and gather the
wheat into his garner3 but the chaff he will burn with fire un-
quenchable.'' Here threshing-floor stands for the catholic
church as the doctors expound, especially Augustine‚ who says
of saith, ad Petrum: “Hold most tenaciously and in no wise
doubt that God's threshing-floor is the catholic church and that
in it the chafi‘ will remain mixed with the wheat till the end of
the world.'' 1, And this judgment of Augustine is confirmed
by Christ’s words: “The kingdom of heaven is like unto a
man who sows good seed in his field,'' and Christ afterward
says: “Let both grow until the harvest,'⁷ Matt. 13 : 30.
Now for the right understanding of these things and the
things to be said, we must lay down out of the apostle's words
that Christ is the head of the universal church, that she is

¹ The quotation is taken from the de fide ad Petrum sive de regula verae fidei,
wrongly ascribed to Augustine, but printed by Migne, 40: 753-780, in the
Appendix to Augustine's works, and with a Preface stating its genuineness to
be a matter of doubt. The work was written by Fulgentius, bishop of Ruspe,
in North Africa, not far from Carthage, d. about 533 ; a vigorous writer against
Arianism and semi-Pelagianism. The treatise was addressed to Peter the
Deaeon, and not to Peter the Apostle, as Huss seems to think. For Peter the
Deacon who was sent on a mission to Pope Hormisdas, see Wetzer-Welte,
9 : 1907 sq. The treatise is a high church document, and is quoted at least
three times in the Corp. jur. can„ and under the name of Augustine, viz., C.
1 : 1, 55; C. 15 z 1, 3; de consol„ D. 4 ε 3, Friedberg‚ 1:379, 746,1376. The
writer follows up the words cited above by saying: “The wicked are mixed
with the good in the communion of the sacraments; and in every profession,
whether it be the profession of clerics‚ monastics, or laics, the wicked and the
good are mingled. . . . The wicked are to be tolerated for the sake of the
good so far as the reason of saith and love demand.'' Fulgentius declared that
“A heretic or a schismatic, though they had been baptized in the name of the
Trinity‚ are outside the catholic church, no matter how much they might give
in charity and even though they sweat blood for the name of Christ, yet they
could not be saved unless they became incorporated into the catholic church,''
