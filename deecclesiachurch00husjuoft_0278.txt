224 THE CHURCH

to obey contrary to God; the second, when the work is vol-
untary; the third, when it is pure from the standpoint of a
holy purpose, in accordance with the Saviour's teaching, when
he said: “If thine eye is single, thy whole body shall be full
of light,'' Matt. 6 ε 22. The fourth condition is when the
work is judicious, because neither defect nor excess infects
it, and the fifth, when it is permanently persevered in, as an
obligation, even to the end. From this it is clear that an
inferior, recognizing a superior’s injudicious command, that
it is known or should be known as fitted to hurt the church,
by drawing away from the worship of God and the profit of
souls unto salvation,—he ought to resist that superior. For
such resistance is true obedience done not only to God in
view of the law of fraterna] correction but also to the su-
perior himself, for no superior has the right to command
anything except what is good. Since, therefore, an inferior
is obligated, for obedience's sake, to do that which is gener-
ically good and commanded by the superior, it follows that
he is obeying in so resisting him, as he ought3 for he thereby
does what is good, and turns away from what is evil. Hence,
it is clear that a subject, in obeying his prelate in that which
is evil, is not excused from sin, for the Saviour says: “If the
blind guide1 the blind, both fall into the pit,’' Matt. 15 : 14.

This means that if a “blind man‚'' that is, an ignorant
or bad prelate, guides “a blind man‚'' that is, an ignorant or
bad subject, by commanding him to do something, they both
fall into the pit of error. Hence, Christ aptly says to his
disciples in regard to the scribes and Pharisees—who taught
that it is a sin to eat bread with unwashen hands, when it
is nevertheless not a sin:—“Let them alone, they are blind
leaders of the blind.'' What does “let thern alone'' mean?
The Gloss says, “Leave them to their own wi113 they are
blind,'' that is, they are obscured by traditions.

And this rule of Christ the very brute animals observe‚
