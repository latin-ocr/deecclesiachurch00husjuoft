 

THE POPE NOT THE CHURCH’S HEAD 129

standing in the holy place‚’' Matt. 24 : 15. The apostle also
says: “Let no man beguile you in any wise, for it will not
be except the falling away come first and the man of sin be
revealed, the son of perdition; he that opposeth and exalteth
himself against all that is called God or is worshipped; so
that he sitteth in the temple of God Setting himself forth
as God‚'’ II Thess. 2 : 3-4. And it is apparent from the
Chronicles how the papal dignity has sunk.

For the emperor Constantine, about A. D. 301, thought
and commanded that the highest bishop should be called by
all pope and in his dotation that name also sprang up. The
emperor Phocas likewise, about the year 600, at the instance
of the clergy confirmed this same thing, as may be read in
his Annals. Therefore, Castrensis, 4 : 14, describes how the
excellency of the Roman empire helped the papacy of the
Roman pontiff above others. He says: “The N icene coun-
cil conierred this prerogative on the Roman pontifi, that,
just as Augustus had rank above other kings‚ so the Roman
pontiff should be held as bishop, and the pope be called chief
father—principalis pater.’' ¹ The origin, however, of this name
and this excellency is to be found in the dotation of the
chureh, as is indicated in the Decretum, 96, Dist. Constant.2

¹ Rolls Series, 5 ε 140, Castrensis prefaces the words quoted by Huss with
the statement that “in the early church there were only three patriarchs‚ corre-
sponding to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, namely Antioch, Alexandria, and
Rome. Peter constructed these three seats by his occupancy-——sua sessione.
Over two of them he himself was president and his disciple, Mark, occupied the
third, Alexandria.'' Of course the Nicene council, 325, did no such thing but
in its sixth canon makes the three bishops of Alexandria, Rome, and Antioch,
each supreme in his own diocese. See Schaff, Ch. H ist„ ΙΙΙ, ²75·

² Constantine's donation was the reputed gift to Pope Sylvester of dominion
over the city of Rome, Italy, and all the provinces, cities, and territories of
the West. The gift, it was alleged, was made out of gratitude to Sylvester for
having healed the emperor of leprosy and baptized him. In view of Sylvester's
healing power, Constantine was assured of the divine power given to Peter
and his successors. In addition, the emperor also acknowledged the Roman
bishop as universal pope and his supremacy over Antioch, Alexandria, Jeru-
salem and Constantinople‚ called him the vicar of the Son of God, and as Huss

notes, M on„ 1 : 337, gave him the Lateran palace. This colossal fraud of the
middle of the eighth century was a part of the Pseudo-Isidorian decretals‚ and
