FAITH 71

removed, they should neither doubt, nor grant, nor deny but
only hope for. For example, if it were proposed to me, “Thou
shalt be saved‚’' Ι ought not to grant it, for I do not know
whether it is true, nor should Ι deny it, for Ι do not know
whether it is false, nor should I doubt it—but I should hope

and his curia make mistakes from ignorance of the truth.
And, with reference to this ignorance, it can be substantiated
that the pope makes mistakes and may be deceived. Lucre

far, however, saith ought to be placed in the letters of princes,
the instruments of notaries, and the descriptions of men, ex-
perience, which is the teacher of things, teaches. For she
teaches that these three often make mistakes. Of one kind
is the saith which is placed in God. He cannot deceive or
be deceived3 of another is the saith placed in the pope, who
