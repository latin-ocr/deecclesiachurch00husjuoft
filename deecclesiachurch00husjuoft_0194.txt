trated in him. From this, then, the argument is constructed:
a man is the vicar of the person whose place he fills and
from whom, in a legitimate way, he receives procuratorial
power [delegated as with the Roman procurators]. But no one
truly occupies the place of Christ, or Peter, unless he fol-
lows him in his life, for no other kind of following is more
fitting; nor does any one otherwise receive procuratorial
power. The requirements, therefore, of the vicarial office
are conformity of life and authority from him who appoints.
If, therefore, the pope is a most humble man, depending
little upon mundane honors and the gain of this world, if
he is a shepherd deriving his name from the pasturage of
God’s Word, of which pasturage the Lord said to Peter,
“Pasture my sheep‚'' John 21 z 17, if he pasture the sheep
by the Word and the example of his virtues being made en-
sample of the flock with his whole beart, as Peter says, I
Peter 5 : 3, if he is meek, patient, chaste, laboring anxiously
and solicitously in the service of the church, esteeming all
temporal things as dung—then, without doubt, is he the true
vicar of Jesus Christ, manifest to God and men, so far as the
judgment of the outward senses can determine. But, if he
lives at discord with these virtues—for there is “no com-
munionl between Christ and Belial,’' II Cor. 6 : 15, and, as
Christ himself said, “He that is not with me is against,’'
Matt. 12 : 3o—how can he be the true and manifest vicar
of Christ or of Peter and not rather the vicar of antichrist,
seeing he resists Christ in morals and in life?

Therefore, when Peter was opposed to Christ in will and
words and after Christ had promised him the keys, Christ
called Peter Satan, that is, “adversary,'' and said: “Get
thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offence to me, because
thou savorest not the things that be of God but the things
that be of men.'' If, therefore, Peter, chosen to be Christ’s
first vicar by Christ and deputed to serve the church in
