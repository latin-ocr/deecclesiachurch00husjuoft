last chapter of the Ephesians, a passage he frequently ex-
pounded.¹

Indeed, heresy has its uses, and heretics are to be re-
claimed to Christ’s sheepfold by methods of persuasion, so
Huss affirmed. As for himself, he professed that excommu-
nication and the harshest treatment are rather to be chosen
than a pretended absolution from guilt and punishment, for
he is more likely to be absolved from guilt and punishment
who, in God’s cause, suffers malediction and contumely even
unto death, than he who prevaricates to himself or persecutes
Christians.²

Thus, a hundred years before Luther wrote his famous
words against the buming of here'tics, Huss took the same
position. But, so far as we know, there was not a single
individual in the great council of Constance who had any
sympathy with the views of the Bohemian heretic. Nay,
the council went further than to burn Huss: it supplemented
its verdict by a solemn declaration that faith is not to be
kept with a heretic. The pity is that Bullinger—in the
Second Helvetic Confession, John Calvin and other leaders
of the emancipation of the sixteenth century did not fully
conform to the principle set forth by Huss and Luther and
shake themselves free from the method of the inquisition
practised by our religious ancestors of the Middle Ages.

These fundamental principles, in regard to the church,
the papal office, the keys and the Scriptures, for which
Huss stood were adapted to shake the ecclesiastical organiza-
tion of his day to its very foundations. The council of
Constance when it stated them in its thirty charges fully
appreciated the grave menace. Had that solemn assembly
accepted Huss's principles it would have set aside the con-
struction built up by the pride of the mediaeval hierarchy
and the laborious reasoning of the Schoolmen.
