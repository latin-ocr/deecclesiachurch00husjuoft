228 THE CHURCH

not do their works,” Matt. 24 : 26. For he himself exhorted
the priests and the multitude to examine and judge in re-
spect to his works, saying, “Which of you convicteth me of
sin?'’ John 8 : 46, and, “Though ye believe not me, believe
the works,’' John 10 ; 38. And what an evil it is of Christ’s
church that our superiors make a larger demand that belief
be given to all their approving and condemning judgments,
than that belief be given to the saith of holy Scriptum,
which is the catholic saith. And they punish more severely
for departure from their traditions than they do those who
blaspheme against that most excellent saith of Christ. And
so to them the words of the Psahn [41 z 9] may be applied:
“He that ate of my bread hath lifted up his heel against
me.’' For as they affirm, they themselves eat up Christ’s
patrimony and nevertheless they put a higher value on their
commandments than on the commandments of our Lord
Jesus Christ himself.
