ROMAN PONTIFF AND CARDINALS 57

all are Christ's sheep, and the one fold is of one shepherd?
This is the meaning of the aforesaid decretal of Boniface,
which closes with these words: “Further we declam, say and
determine that to be subJect to the Roman pontiff is for every
human being altogether necessary for salvation'’—subesse
Romano pontifici omni humanoe creaturae . . . omnino esse de
necessitate salutis. If, therefore, every man is of necessity
subjected by this declaration to the Roman pontiff, the afore-
said proposition will follow as true, and, on the other hand,
the proposition that the Roman church is the church, whose
head is the pope and whose body the cardinals, and these to-

holy catholic and apostolic church. Therefore, what seemed
a matter of doubt is false. The first proposition is made out

being that the pope is the head of the Roman church and the
body is the college of cardinals. The second is manifest from
the fact that the pope with the cardinals is not the totality
of all the elect.

For the understanding of this subject the notable passage
of the Gospel must be meditated upon, namely, Matt. 16 : 16—

hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in
heaven. And Ι also say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and
upon this rock I will build my church3 and the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it. Ι will give unto thee the keys of
the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on
earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt
loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.’' In this passage are
designated Christ's church, its saith, the foundation, and the
authority. In these words Christ’s church is designated‚ “I
will build my church'’; in these Peter's saith, “Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God'’; in these the foundation,
