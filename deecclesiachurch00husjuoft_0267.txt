 

THE APOSTOLIC SEE 2 13

Hence Augustine, Com. on Psalm 122 : 5 [Nic. Fathers,
7 : 594], “The seats sat in judgment‚'' speaks thus of the
thing in question: “How did those seats sit in judgment?
Wonderful enigma, wonderful question, if seat does not mean
what the Greeks call throne! The Greeks call chairs thrones,
as something honorable. Therefore, my brethren, it is not
wonderful if men sit on seats‚ on chairs‚ but that the seats
themselves sit, how are we to understand this? As if some
one were to say, let the cathedras sit here, or the chairs

thundered terrors, rained consolations. Therefore the right-
eous were heaven and ‘declared the glory of God.' Now
that ye may know that these are the heavens spoken of, it
is said in the same Psalm, ‘Their sound is gone out through
all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.'
You ask, Whose sound? and you will find, the sound of the
heavens. If, therefore, heaven is God’s seat and the apos-
