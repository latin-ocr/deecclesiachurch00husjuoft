fore, O ye who love Christ's law from the heart, first note
their works and see is they [the superiors] incline to the
world, second give heed to their commands, whether they
savor of avarice or the gain of this world, and third consult
holy Scripture whether they command in accordance with
Christ’s counsel. And in the light of this counsel believe
them; or disbelieve them, if they command contrary to this
counsel. But let not curates say to laics, ‘What concern
is it of yours to take note of our life or works,' for did not
our Saviour say: “Do not according to their works''? Matt.

the apostle says: “We command you in the name of Jesus

him eat.'’ II Thess. 3 z 6, 10.

eternal death, if they did not judge wisely about these things,
how far they ought to believe their superiors, how far follow
them, and in what things they ought intelligently to obey
them according to the Lord’s law. For that best oi masters,
the Lord, admonished us in advance to “beware of false
prophets and the leaven of the Pharisees‚’' Matt. 7: 153
16 : 11. He also said: “Believe not, go not forth and do
