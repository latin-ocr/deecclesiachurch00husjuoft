72 THE CHURCH

may deceive and be deceived. Of one kind is the saith placed
in holy Scripture; and another, faith in a bull thought out
in a human way. For to holy Scripture exception may not
be taken, nor may it be gainsaid; but it is proper at times
to take exception to bulls and gainsay them when they
either commend the unworthy or put them in authority, or
savor of avarice‚ or honor the unrighteous or oppress the in-
nocent, or implicitly contradict the commands or counsels of
God.

It is, therefore, plain which saith is the foundation of the
church—the saith with which the church is built upon the
Rock, Christ Jesus, for it is that by which the church confesses
that “Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God.” For Peter
spoke for all the faithful, when he said: “Thou art the Christ,
the Son of the living God.'' “This is the victory‚’' says John,
“which overcometh the world—even our saith. Who is he
that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus
is the Son of God?'' Ι John 5 : 4.
