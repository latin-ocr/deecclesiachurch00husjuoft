priests, to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then
for the sins of the people, for this he did once for all when
he offered himself.''

Truly this is the most holy and chief Roman pontiff, sit-
ting at God's right hand and dwelling with us, for he said:
“And lo, I am with you all the days, even unto the consum-
mation of the age,'' Matt. 28 : 20. For that person, Christ,
is everywhere present, since he is very God whose right it is

not think it robbery to be equal with God but emptied him-
self, taking upon him the form of a servant, because he hurn-
bled himself by being made obedient unto death, even the
death of the cross. Wherefore God hath highly exalted
him and given him a name which is above every name,
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things
