270 THE CHURCH

Minor excommunication is separation on account of mortal
sin from participation in spiritual benefits by which a man
makes himself unworthy through criminal offence to continue
to participate in grace, and this excommunication no one may
impose upon a man who persists in God's grace. Major ex-
communication is the separation which the prelates of the
church announce against a man as an open sinner, and by
which they set him off from intercourse with Christians and
from participation in the sacraments.

By this excommunication they now designate me in proc-
esses and denunciations, shutting me out from all human
communion. But blessed be God, who did not give such
force to this [kind of] excommunication as to make it possible
for it to take away from a good man virtue or righteousness,
when he endures in humssity, nor is it able to impose upon
him sin [when he refuses to obey it]. Nay, rather when he
has patiently continued to endure it helps to purify him as
tools iron, and fire gold, and it helps to increase his reward
of beatitudo, as the Lord said: “Blessed are ye when men
shall persecute you, and separate you from their company,
and reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the
Son of man's sake. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for
behold, great is your reward in heaven, for in the same man-
ner did their fathers do unto the prophets,'' Luke 6 : 22, 23.

But this [major] excommunication ought to be medicinal,
that is, a remedy to heal a man in his soul and to lead him
him,' then he is bound not merely by the minor excommunication which sep-
arates from participation in the sacraments‚ but also by the major excom-
munication which separates from the communion oi the faithful.’' This dis-
tinction is usually raeolved into a difference in the solemnities attending the
announcement. Since Martin V's decree, 1418, a distinction has been made
between excommunicated persons to be tolerated and avoided—tolerati et υἰ-
tandi. In case one of the latter is present at any meeting, the priest must
interrupt the service. With those who are to be avoided are forbidden all passing
of words. prayer, greetings, intercourse and fellowship at the table. See
Hergenrother‚ 567 sqq.‚· Friedberg, K.-recht‚ pp. 293 sqq. Wyclif, de Eccles„
153 sqq. and de dom. civ„ 300 sq„ gives the conditions justifying excommuni-

cation and refers to the distinction between minor and major excommunica-
tion and the solemn extinguishing of candles in the latter.
