278 THE CHURCH

ing above what the priests of the old law had, and yet
they exercise this office less. Therefore‚ as there is a greater
reason now underlying the duty to preach‚ and as the same
Lord is present, who is not able to withhold final vengeance
in view of the greater sin in not preaching, and the demands
of His justice, it is clear that if our prelates are of this kind,
they are under a more severe suspension. Yea, and they
are under a still more severe suspension in so far as they are
under more urgent obligation to fervently proclaim Christ's
law in these times of antichrist.

So far as the second kind of suspension goes—that of
Eli pronounced by God—the faithful should note whether
our prelates either do not punish at all οι· punish their
spiritual sons as more guilty than the natural sons of Eli, who
were punished of God. And in order to discern their greater
guilt, the faithful ought to note these two things: (1) that a
prelate is under greater obligation to his spiritual son than
any one by the law of reason is to his natural son and (2)
that more detestable is the punishment meted out on ac-
count of the lack of money for which [pardon for] sin is sold
than is a punishment remitted for the vindication of an in-
jury against God out of natural affection, as Eli seems to
have spared his sons, So far as the third kind of suspen-
sion goes, as it holds for prelates, kings‚ and other secular
princes, let the faithful note that the prelates show more
favor to the public enemies of God for the sake of their own
comfort than Saul showed to Amalek moved by lust for his
temporal goods. If this is so, then there is no doubt but
that the same God who at all times must exercise the same
justice punishes the delinquent more severely. Therefore‚
it is an evident mark of the severity of punishment that
God puts off punishment till after death and does not pun-
ish them in this life in any other way but permits thern
to wander about in mundane prosperity as reprobates who
are not reproved.
