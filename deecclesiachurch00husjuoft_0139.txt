THE CHURCH FOUNDED ΟΝ CHRIST 85

And so Peter heard from the Lord's lips the words: “Blessed
art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for fiesh and blood hath not re-
vealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.’'
And because of this faith Peter received the burden of the
church’s prefecture. And the Rock said: “I say that thou
art Peter and upon this Rock Ι will build my church.'’ Hence,
on account of these things Peter's vicars and those appointed
to rule in the church are bound to preach the church's faith.
Therefore‚ the Saviour said: “I have prayed for thee, that
thy saith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast turned
again, establish thy brethren,'' Luke 22:32. Therefore,
praying for saith, “he was heard for his godly fear,⁷’ Heb.
5 ε 7.

In the second place the Lord joined with him the pri-
macy of office. After my death, he said: “I will give to thee
the keys of the kingdom of heaven,'' that is, the keys of the
church, which I will strengthen and defend against the church
of the wicked by giving to thee the power of binding and loos-
ing that thou mayest‚ not without avail, hold the keys of the
church which Ι have given thee for thy meritorious confession
of my humanity and deity, of which, taught by the Father,
after a heavenly manner, thou didst say: “Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God.’' Therefore, because of
his confession, so confident and profound, he was called
Cephas, which is by interpretation Peter, John 1 ε 42. For
this reason Jerome, expert in languages, says: “that Cephas
means Peter, or firmness, and that it is a Syriae not a He-
brew word.'' This affords the solution of the last objec-
tion3 for Cephas does not mean head, according to the
Gospel and Jerome, but Peter.

Peter's second virtue was humility. Inasmuch as Peter
heard ,from his Master the words, “Learn of me, for Ι am
meek and lowly of heart‚'' Matt. 11 : 29 and, “whosoever
will be great among you, let him be your minister; and who-
soever will be first among you, let him be your servant‚'’ Matt.
