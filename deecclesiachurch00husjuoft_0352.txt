298 THE CHURCH

dicted and aliens from the holy priesthood. The reason is
because those simoniacs buy and sell excommunications, sus-
pensions and interdicts‚ and with these as their weapons
they feed and defend their simony most powerfully. And a
proof is not necessary, for this simoniacal trafficking is patent
even to the eye of rustics, who are bound, vexed‚ oppressed
and plundered by these selfsame simoniacs. For to such
proportions has this heresy of Simon Magus and Gehazi
grown that men without compunction in season and out of
season, and even the unwilling, are impelled on to this sort
of criminal offence. And all trafficking of this sort arises
from the method in vogue with the Roman curia, which prac-
tises it in turn with the curias of the bishops after the man-
ner of Simon Magus and Gehazi. This appears in the dimis-
sorial letters for confirmings, pardonings‚ admissions‚ and also
in other things invented to get pecuniary plunders.¹

Now, as to the condemnation of the XLV Articles‚² it
should be said—but I speak briefly-—that up to this day the

¹ Literae dimissoriales is the name given to licenses by ecclesiastical supe-
riors, setting aside the usual ecclesiastical practices, whatever they may be,
from pope down to priest, as, for example, when a. bishop grants permission
to ordain a candidate of his diocese to a bishop of another diocese. Huss is
referring to licenses given by popes or bishops to agents to perform acts pre-
sumably for temporal favors. See Hergenrother, K.-recht‚ 236, 239, etc.

²The XLV Articles of Wyclif‚ action upon which was first taken at Prague
by the university, 1403, and more recently and drastically, 1412, forbidding
any to hold or teach them, they being heretical‚ seditious‚ scandalous and
erroneous, Doc„ 451 sq. At the city hall of the Old Town King Wenzel had
the prohibition of the articles publicly announced, Doc„ 456. It seems
strange that Huss has not before mentioned these XLV Articles by name,
which were the first cause of his troubles in Prague. In his Reply to Stanislaus,
Mon„ 1 ε 331 sq„ he starts out with a prolonged reference to them and re-
minds Stanislaus that he was one of the doctors of the theological faculty, all
of whom now condemned the articles as heretical‚ etc.‚ 1412, who originally
had taken most positive ground on the other side and strenuously defended
thern. Likewise in his Reply to Palecz, Huss brings out into prominence the
discussions over the XLV Articlae and makes the statement that Palecz, who
was one of the eight doctors who declared the articles heretical, at one time
had defended them, and in a meeting at the university‚ throwing down one
of Wyclif's writings on the table, had said that he was ready to defend it against
any one who might attack even a single word extracted from it.
