THE LAW OF GOD 169

priests, when they had sent the servants to bring Jesus, wish-
ing to put him to death, and when they said to the servants,

“Hath any of the rulers believed on him or of the Pharisees?
But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed''—
then Nicodemus said to them: “Doth our law judge a man,
except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?’'
John 7 ε 47-51. O blessed Nicodemus, thou didst accord
such force to God’s law; thou didst bear witness to the law
that it should be the judge of man.

See, how inconvenient the statements of our doctors are
when they pronounce the sentence that we wish to have the
law as judge—a judge which judges most justly and does
not judge otherwise than does God, the most just judge.
Thou sayest, “Doth our law judge a man, except it first
hear from him and know what he doeth?” as if he would
say, No, because it judges justly. To that judge Christ re-
ferred the priests, Pharisees, scribes and Jews, who accused
him of sin because he kept not the Sabbath day, and called
God his Father, saying: “Ye search the Scriptures. These
are they which bear witness of me,'' John 5 : 39. Did not,
therefore, Christ wish the Scriptures to judge the Jews which
believed not on Christ? Certainly, he wished it. In pro-
portion, therefore, as the doctors wish that the Scriptures
be not the judge, in that proportion they wish themselves
to be believed that whatever they condemn should be con-
demned and that whatever they approve should be approved.
For this they asked and begged in the city hall; for this they
sought the signatures of the magisters who gainsaid their opin-
ions. But the counsel of the Pharisees, scribes and priests
has come to naught, because the faithful who gainsaid them
were not willing to agree without hearing the proof from the
law, which holds wrapped up in itself all truth that is to
be believed. If the pontiffs, Pharisees, priests and elders
of the people had known this law they would not have con-
demned Christ—but they did condemn and blaspheme. More
