60 THE CHURCH

faith in regard to that most hidden article, the flesh——that is,
the wisdom of the world—does not reveal; nor does blood
reveal it, that is, pure philosophical science-but alone God‚
the Father. And because the confession was so clear and
positive, the Rock—Petra—said to Peter—the rock: “And
I say unto thee that thou art Peter,’' that is, the confessor of
the true Roek—Petra-—who is Christ, and “on this Rock‚”
which thou hast confessed—-that is, upon me-—“I will build''
by strong faith and perfecting grace “my church’'—that is,
the company of the predestinate wh0, the probation being
over, are appointed to glory. Wherefore, “the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it.'’ Up to this point it has been de-
duced from the Saviour's words that there is (1) one church—
namely‚ from the very word “church’'; (2) that it is Christ's
church—from the word “my'’; (3) that it is holy—-from the
words, “the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.’' The
conclusion, therefore, is that there is one holy church of Christ,
which in Greek is katholike and in Latin universalis. She is
also called apostolic, apostolike, because she was established by
the words and deeds of the apostles and founded upon the
Rock, Christ, as Jerome says in the Prologue to his Com-
mentary on tlze A pocalypse.1

Hence I lay it down that it is to be called the holy Roman
church, for the Decretum, Dist. 21 [Friedberg, 1 : 70]‚ says
that “although there is only one bridal couch² of the uni-
versal catholic church of Christ3 throughout the world, never-

¹ Jerome referred the rock now to Christ, Com. on Amos, 6 : 1 2, now to Peter,
now to Peter and his confession. The notable passages in which he makes
Peter the rock are his letter to Marcella, and especially his letter to Damasus,
bishop of Rome, Nic. Fathers, 6 : 18, 55. In commenting on Matt. 16 : 16,
Jerome combined the interpretations Christ and Peter. He can, therefore, be
cited for both interpretations.

²The word transl. conch—thalamus—is used in the Vulgate, Deut. 33 : 12:
“He will abide the whole day on his couch‚” where the proper transl. of the
Hebrew is: “He covereth him all the day long.’' Gilbert of Hoiland, Sermon
on the Cant„ Migne 184 ι 64, says: “There is a conch on the breast of Jesus,
yea and also a treasure,⁷' in pectore ‚Iesu thalamus, etc.

³1 have substituted for Huss’s text, Christus, the text of the Decretum, Christi.
