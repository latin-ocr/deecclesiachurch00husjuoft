 

HUSS'S RESISTANCE TO THE POPE 187

servants of God‚¹ not only a Roman bishop but, in a general
way he is the bishop of all the churches. He is himself the
bishop of Prague. But, as he is a servant or minister not
by the compulsion of civil law, because a life where activi-
ties are moved by compulsion did not befit him, so he is the
bishop of souls, not of secular riches or possessions, for he
as bishop, lowly and meek, mounted the foal of an ass, as is
attested by Zech. 9 ε 9. And he said: “ F oxes have holes,
and the birds of heaven have nests‚ but the Son of Man hath
not where to lay his head,” Matt. 8 : 20. Why was this?
The apostle gives the reason when he says: “Ye know the
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who² for our sakes became
poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich‚’'
II Cor. 8 : 9.

The second definition of obedience is also defective, as is
seen from what has already been said, because it states that
obedience is the disposition to follow the command of a su-
perior. For all obedience is not with respect to a superior
to whom the obedience is rendered, or with respect to a com-
mand. For sometimes obedience is with respect to an in-
ferior, as has been said already. And obedience is also related
to counsel, as when a man obeys the counsels of God, which he
is not under obligation to obey under any pain of mortal sin.
Obedience is also related to entreaty‚ as when God obeyed at
Joshua's entreaty‚ bidding the sun stand still over Gibeon and
not be moved towards its setting. Hence Jerome‚ Ep. 1 13, says:
“God sometimes seems to obey the prayers of the saints.'’
And it is clear that obedience is sometimes a fulfilment of
a command, sometimes of a counsel, and sometimes of an
entreaty‚ which is neither a command nor a counsel. And
sometimes it is the result of persuasion‚ the way in which
the devil persuaded Christ, Matt. 4 : 5, to go with him to

time; Boniface’s bull Unam sanctam opens in that way: “Bon., bish0p‚ the
servant of the servants of God.”
