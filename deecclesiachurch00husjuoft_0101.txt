GOOD AND BAD IN THE CHURCH 47

in sheep's clothing, as Augustine says; and consequently
he was not predestinate and so not a part of the church, the
bride of Christ.

From this it is clear that it would be a great presumption
for any one without revelation and godly fear to assert of
himself that he is a member of that holy church. For no one
except the predesfflnate, in his time without spot or wrinkle‚
is a member of that church. No one, however, without godly
fear or revelation may assert of himself that he is predes-
tinate‚ and holy without spot or wrinkle. Hence the con-
clusion is properly drawn. Wherefore it is exceedingly won-
derful with what effrontery they who are given up to the world,
live completely a worldly and vicious life, removed from
companionship with Christ, and even more barren in the ful-
filment of Christ's counsels and precepts—-that they assert
without godly sear that they are heads or the body or the
chief members of the church, which is Christ's bride. Do we
ever think that these are without spot of mortal sin or wrinkle
of venial sin? By forsaking Christ's counsels, by neglect
of their sacred office, and by their works they teach that we
should rather feel the opposite, for the bridegroom of the
church says, “By their fruits ye shall know them‚'' Matt.
7 : 20, and “believe the works,'' John 10 : 38, and “do not
after their works, for they say and do not,'’ Matt. 23 : 2.

But against these things the objection is raised, first, on
the ground that every cleric, being stamped with the clerical
character or the outward sign by a prelate in the judgment
of the church, is a part of holy mother church, and alone the
body of such clerics is by antonomasial called the church,
which (body) we ought especially to honor, because otherwise
it would follow that Christians would not recognize their
mother. Yea, and, thus not being recognized, they would not

¹ A rhetorical term for the substitution of a title for a general term, as “his
honor'’ for ‘⁴ Judge.'' Wyclif also uses it, de Eccles.‚ 1 ε 400. In the first case
he says: “Christ's bride is antonomatically our mother.’'
