106 THE CHURCH

nize.·’ '' Thus much Augustine, who limits the clergy's power
to loose or bind as it stands in their own estimation.

To the same purport are the words of Richard‚ de potest.
ligandi et solvendi [Migne, 196 ; 1167]. He says: “So far thou
goest and sayest: if I arn not able to bind or absolve anything
or to retain and remit the sins of all persons whatsoever, what
does that mean, which was said in a general way unto Peter:
‘Whatsoever thou shalt bind, whatsoever thou shalt loose' Ρ
Just as it was also laid down as a general rule spoken to the
apostles in common: ‘Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are re-
mitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are re-

said to Peter, ‘Whatsoever thou shalt wish to bind shall be
bound, and whatsoever thou shalt wish to loose shall be loosed,'
but he did not say this nor did he wish to be understood in
this way—namely, if any one shall wish to bind what he is not

a priest's sentence justly deserve absolution,¹ but, beyond any
doubt, the sins of those are retained to whom the absolution
of sins has been justly denied and not those to whom it has
been unjustly denied.

“What the Lord, therefore, said to Peter means the same
as if he had said in other words: ‘What has been bound or
loosed by thee, shall be bound or loosed with me. He who
is held with thee by the command of a required satisfaction
is held with me as a debtor owing the same satisfaction.
And because² he deserved from thee the just absolution for
