 

THE APOSTOLIC SEE 211

those who kill souls are the worst servants of antichrist and

Satan.

In view of these things it is to be held that to rebel against
an erring pope is to obey Christ the Lord, because in mak-
ing his provisions he chiefly makes those which savor of
personal affection. Therefore, I call the world to witness that
the papal distribution oi benefices sows in the church hire-
lings all too widely. On the part of the popes‚ it gives them
occasion to exalt their vicarial power, to put an excessive
value on the world's dignity and to make an extravagant
show of a fantastic sanctity. But these doctors, who are
looking sor temporal remuneration from the pope or servilely
fear his power,l and also are saying that he has mysterious
power and is impeccable and inerrant and that he may do
lawiully whatsoever pleases him—these doctors are pseudo-
prophets and pseudo-apostles of antichrist.

From the things already said, it is clear that the apos-
tolic seat is the authority to judge and teach Christ's law,
or secondly‚ as has been said, it is the family of holy popes
who are successors to Christ. In this sense the apostolic
seat is understood, Dist. 22 [Friedberg, 1 ε 74]‚ where Pope
Anacletus says: “This apostolic seat has been established
as the head and hinge by the Lord and not by another; and
just as a gate is ruled by the hinge, so by the authority of
the holy apostolic seat all the other churches are ruled, sub-
ject to the government of the Lord.'' That pope intended
that he himself should be the head and hinge, the head
in presiding and the hinge in ruling, but he has a weak
enough argument for proving his purpose. For he argues
from things that are alike‚ when he says: “As a gate is ruled
by its hinge, so by the authority of the holy apostolic see
all the churches are ruled.'' It would have been sufficient
to argue that the pope and cardinals rule themselves well.

¹ Huss frequently ascribes the changed attitude of Palecz and Stanislaus to
the sear of ecclesiastical penalties, Doc., 53, 466, etc.
