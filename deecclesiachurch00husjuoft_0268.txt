214 THE CHURCH

tles are heaven, then they are themselves made God's seat;
they are God’s throne. In another place it is said: ‘The
soul of the righteous man is the throne of wisdom.' This
is a great thing which is said, namely, in the soul of the
righteous man wisdom sits as on its throne and from there

first seat of the apostle Peter, and so Pope Marcellus says,
24 ε 1 [Friedberg‚ 1 z 9701: “We beseech you brethren that
ye teach and think nothing else than what was taught by
St. Peter the apostle and the remaining apostles and Fathers.'’
And further on: “His seat, that is, Peter’s, was the primary
