78 THE CHURCH

of God1 in word, and in deeds, and in the power of signs and
wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit. And so Ι have
preached this Gospel not where Christ was already known,
that I might not build upon another man’s foundation,''
Romans 15: 18—20. Was not this that apostle, a vessel of
election, who said he did not dare to preach anything save
those things which Christ spoke through him; for otherwise
he would not be building on Christ, the most effectual foun-
dation, if perchance he should say and teach or do anything
which did not have its foundation in Jesus Christ. And from
this it is plain, that not Peter but the Rock, Christ, was in-
tended in Christ's GospeL when Christ said: “On this Rock
Ι will build my ehurch.''

But the objection is drawn from Ambrose, Dist. 50 [Fried-
berg‚ 1 ε 198], where he says: “Peter became more faithful
after he had wept over having relinquished his faith and so
he found greater grace than he lost. For as a good shepherd
he received the flock to care for it so that, as he had been weak
to himself, he might become a buttress—firmamentum—to all,
and he who faltered,² under the temptation of a question,
might establish others by the steadfastness of his saith.
Finally, in order to strengthen the devotion of the ehurches,
he was called rock, as the Lord said: ‘thou art Peter and
upon this rock I will build my ehurch.' For he is called
petra—rock—because he was to be the first to lay the foun-
dations of the saith among the nations‚³ and, as an immov-
able bowlder-—saxum-he held up the structure and weighty
edifice of the whole of Christ's work.’' So much Ambrose,
showing that Peter is called the rock. The exposition of
Augustine, the foremost of Scripture expositors, seems to me
here to be more efficacious and is more efficacious because it
