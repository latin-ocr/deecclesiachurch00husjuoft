174 THE CHURCH

pieces. Woe to the shepherd and idoll that leaveth the
flock !” If, therefore, this description of “the idol'' and this
forsaking of the flock fit the pope, how could the saying of
the doctors be true of any possible pope in the future, that
he is the high priest, the true and manifest successor of Peter,
presiding over the church which is the bride of Christ? For
it does not follow,——he is the idol [worthless shepherd] who
forsakes the flock; therefore, he is the high priest, the true
and manifest successor of Peter. And it also does not follow,—

him “Augustine, our lord and most holy and blessed pope.'' ²
And so likewise the saints are reported to have spoken of
prelates when they saw them straying away from the steps
of Christ, and said they were to be condemned or were mem-

works directly at variance with Christ and yet call him most
holy father, for it is written, “Woe unto thern that call
evil good and good evil‚'' Isaiah 5 : 20, for by their lying
flattery they deceive both themselves and him. For, again,
