264 THE CHURCH

have been received by the body of the clergy in Prague, and
they have obeyed them, therefore, they ought to be obeyed.''
It is as if we should argue in this way: because processes
were received by the body of the clergy in Jerusalem against
Christ, that he is a seducer, malefactor, and blasphemer
excommunicate and guilty of death, therefore, those proc-
esses are to be obeyed by the doctors themselves. The con-
clusion from the law of similarity holds by that middle term
of cause, “because the processes were received by the clergy''
—and the doctors of theology ought to be ashamed for
that conclusion, and especially Stanislaus, for he is the ablest
logician amongst them. Perhaps they learned that conclu-
sion from the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees who for-
mulated a like conclusion. For when Pilate said unto them,
“What accusation bring ye against this man?'' they answered
and said (formulating this conclusion): “If this man were
not an evil-doer we would not have delivered him up to
thee‚'' John 18 z 29—30. And again they followed the same
line of argument when Pilate said, “I find no case against
him‚'' when they replied, “We have a law and according to
that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son
of God‚'’ John 19 z 7. In the first conclusion, formulated by
the Jews, the doctors implied that they themselves did not
err when they said: “If this one were not an evil-doer, we
would not have delivered him up to thee”—that is, because
he is an evil-doer, therefore have we delivered him up to
thee. Similarly our doctors reply in the conclusion they
formulate that the body of the clergy in Prague cannot err;
otherwise, if they were able to err, their conclusion would
not be valid. And because that body is able to err in ac-
cepting the processes, so also it does err in securing them
and wickedly executing them. Therefore, the conclusion of
the doctors is not a good one.

And I wonder how this enormous conclusion—cauda—of
the doctors, by which they wish to cover up their shame by
