To the same purport speaks Jerome, whom the Master of
Sentences quotes (see above), and Gregory, 1 : 1, Paulus.
The same holds good 101 1116 retention and binding 01 sins.
Hence the Master 01 86111611665, 4 : 18, 4 [Migne, p. 376], ad-
ducing these authorities and reasons, concludes, that “God
alone washes a man within clean from the stain 01 sin and
from the debt 01 61611131 punishment,” and he closes thus:

alone and 01 Himself forgives sins; and just as He forgives
some so He retains the sins 01 others.''

ye retain‚'' eto? What, therefore, is it 101 3 priest to loose or
bind sins, 10 remit or retain? To the first the Master 01

to participation in the sacraments.’' To the second Richard

except to relax 1116 5611161166 01 punishment which is due for
sins, and by relaxing to absolve ? And what is it to retain sins
but not to absolve those not truly penitent? For many 01
