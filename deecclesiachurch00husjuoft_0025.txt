INTRODUCTION xxi

Samaritan city. By tears and prayers and Christian minis-
tries should the supreme pontifi and priests fulfil their
office.¹

Along the same line of curbing the assumptions of the
priesthood, Huss insists in this treatise upon the right of in-
feriors, including laymen, to examine the mandates of the
clergy and ecclesiastical superiors before giving them heed.
Even the civil realm has the right to punish priests and to
remove thern from their offices as did, so Huss affirms‚
Charles IV, king of Bohemia, and as Titus and Vespasian at
God’s command had done in destroying Jerusalem and the
priests.²

4. The Scriptures. They are the supreme rule of faith
and conduct. This treatise and all Huss’s writings abound
in Scripture quotations. A charge made against him by
Stephen Palecz was that more than any neretic before him,
he had fortified his heresies by appeals to the sacred volume.³
Huss expressed his hope to die in the faith, but also that at
the great judgment bar he might be found not to have denied
a single iota of their contents.4 Charged with following
Wyclif‚ he replied that if he accepted Wyclif’s statements,
it was because they were drawn from the Scriptures. The
holy volume, he maintained, is a book of life, an animate
thing. The priest’s main duty is to set forth its truths and,
in being true to it, it is not possible to incur damnation

2ΜονιἾ 1 : 170, etc. So far as I knOW‚ Huss nowhere took up the case of
the emperor Traian, a topic of constant discussion in the M iddle Ages, in which
Wyclif also joined. According to the story, Trajan was prayed by Gregory the
Great out of hell into heaven, the only pagan to get to the abode of bliss. The
solemn question was whether he had gone direct to heaven as John of Damascus
claimed, or whether he first was brought back to the earth in order to be bap-
tized, then dying over again before being taken up to the abode of the blessed
as Thomas Aquinas, Durandus, and others asserted. Wyclif‚ de Eccles.‚ 531
sqq„ accepted the story but was concemed to show that Trajan's going to
heaven was by virtue of predestination. Bellarmine, de Purg., 2 : 8, discusses
the subject.
