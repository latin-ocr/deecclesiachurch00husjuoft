CHRIST THE ONLY HEAD OF THE CHURCH 31

that any reprobate should be a member of the church. The
antecedent is clear from that notable principle, “that God
is not able to know or love anything de n0v0,'' as Augustine
says, de T rinitate, 6 [Nic. Famem, 3 : 103]. For God is not
able to begin to know anything or to give up knowing any-
thing or to call forth an act of his will, for he is unchangeable
and also because the divine knowledge or volition is not con-
ditioned by anything from without.

From this it is evident that Christ loves the whole church
as he loves himself, because he loves her now, just as he will
love her after the day of judgment, when she will reign with
him as is plain from the Canticles. For, otherwise, there
would not be a true marriage out of the never-ending love of
Christ, a party to the divine nuptials, if the bridegroom who
is one person with the bride did not love her even as he loves
himself. To this the apostle was speaking when he said:
“Christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he
might purify it, washing it in the laver of water, the word of
life, that he might present it unto himself a glorious church,
not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it
should be holy and without blernish,'’ Eph. 5 ε 26, 27. For
this reason Bernard, in his 12th homily on the Canticles
[Migne, 183 : 831] says: “The church is Christ's body,
dearer to him than the body he gave to the grave.'' It is
plain, therefore, that it is befitting that Christ always love
his bride, the holy church, just as he will love her after the
day of judgment3 and in the same way he hates every rep-
robate, just as he will hate him after the day of judgment.
For, inasmuch as God knows fully what the end of every
reprobate will be, and what penance every predestinate
person who falls will, with God’s unending grace, do—it is
evident that God loves a predestinate person who sins more
than he loves any reprobate person, no matter what measure
of grace the latter may enjoy in time, because God wills that
the predestinate have perpetual blessedness and the repro-
