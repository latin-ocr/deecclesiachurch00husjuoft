hand, he did not adopt Wyclii's doctrine of the eucharist
but to the end insisted that he was wrongly charged with
denying the church's dogma of transubstantiation.

V. IMPORTANCE. Huss's treatise has a place of first
irnportance among works on the church. Its treatment is
clear, elaborate and professedly based on Scripture. It is
the best known work on the subject issued from Augus-
tine to the Reformation per³0d. It was the basis of charges
in the most famous formal trial of a single individual in the
history of the Christian church.¹ It was cherished and used
by a large section of the Bohemian people. It has had a
permanent influence upon the development of the idea of
the church.

Upon the council assembled at Constance Huss’s vol-
ume made a deep impression as a work calculated to be
disastrous in its effects, unless counteracted by the severest
measures within the church’s reach. One of its foremost
leaders, that eminent man Cardinal d'Ailly‚ who had prob-

declared that by an abundance of proofs Huss's treatise com-
bated the plenary authority of the church as much as the
Koran combats Christ.²

Wyclif’s Treatise on the Church was hidden away in man-

narrowing groups of Lollards. That memory, indeed, was
powerful‚ for the early Protestant Reformers looked back to
him and Tyndale wrote: “They said it in Wyclif's day and
the hypocrites say it now, that God's Word arouseth in-

rather than Arius himself, were on trial at the council oi Nice, though Arius
became personally involved, being restored, however, after he had been ban-
ished and his books burned. Of course, Savonatola‘s trial lacked the imposing
element involved in the trial of Huss, an oecumenical council.
