THE CARDINALS 139

of all Christians, Christ and the church.'' See, how the
doctor of holy church shows us another holy church with
its head than the one defined of the [eight] doctors who,
without support of Scripture, say that the body of the holy
Roman church is the college of cardinals, for which college
it were well if its parts were members of the holy church of
Jesus Christ. And we ought to think how St. Augustine
himself feared to call Christ Lord-man, for the reason that
this sense does not appear in Scripture; therefore much more
ought we to fear to call any Christian head of the holy church
militant, lest Christ perhaps be blasphemed‚ to whom this
name is reserved by the Nicene council, Trinitatis concilio,
as proper to him. How, then, do the doctors‚ without any
Scripture proof, teach that the pope is head of holy church
and the college its body? Since it is enough for the faithful
Christian with inwrought faith and perseverance to believe
the article of faith concerning the catholic church that it is
the one totality of all the predestinate faithful who are to
be saved by virtue of the merit of Christ—who is the head
of the catholic church—it is not permissible for us expressly
to descend to any particular vicar whom the Christian
might recognize as the chief—capitalis. For many have been
saved in Judea, Asia and Ethiopia who have believed in
Christ, following the teaching of the apostles, and who did
not expressly recognize Peter, nay, or expressly believe what
concerns Peter, just as they did not hear anything about
him.

The third point is this: the pope is the manifest and

I have treated in Chapter VII near the close. It is, however,
to be said again that the doctors do not prove this point.
And, as the vicar ought to occupy the place of his superior
from whom he has received vicarial power, therefore, oc-
cupying his place, he ought more directly to be conformed
to him in his works or otherwise the power would be frus-
