1 2 THE CHURCH

the head of the church, Cant. 5 : 1, making merry with his
friends and companions: “Let us be drunken‚ my beloved‚'’
[drink abundantly, Rev. Vers.]. But the two other parts in the
hand of the Lord and to be purged through the merit of the
church are set forth by those two parts which the priest holds
in his hands, the greater, being laid down, signifies the militant
church and the lesser, resting upon it, signifies the church
waiting in purgatory. For this church in purgatory depends
upon the suffrages of the church militant. And for these two
parts we pour out our double prayers to the Lamb‚ who is
the head of the church, that he may have mercy upon us.
But as for the third part, to whose dwelling-place and rest
we look forward, we pray that the same Lamb of the three-
fold nature may at last give us peace. For this reason, Christ
in his state of humiliation visited three places of the church,
(1) the navel of our habitable world, dwelling thirty-three
years in Judea and Jerusalem; (2) the limbus, in which the
Fathers were purified, by bringing out a fragment of his
church in the spirit, and (3) ascending to heaven he led
captivity captive, which, after his triumph, he crowned by
placing it at God’s right hand.1 This, therefore, is the three-
fold division of this one universal or catholic church, al-
though, however, there are particular churches.

he drinks. The priest holds the two larger parts so that the smaller of the two
lies upon the other. Thomas Aquinas, Summa, 3 z 84 [Migne, 3 z 851]‚ mentions
the custom of dropping a fragment into the cup.

¹ Jerusalem was regarded in the Middle Ages as the navel of the earth. The
cross, according to Jerome, was erected over Adam’s skull, which Shem had
carried to Jerusalem after the Flood, and buried on the future Mount Calvary.
Noah, according to Jacob oi Edessa, had taken Adam's bones with him into
the ark. The region limbus patrum was, according to the Schoolmen, the
future abode, where the patriarchs and faithful Jews were detained until Christ's
“descent into Hades.’' The future world is divided into five abodes, hell, the
“place of dolors ” (Th. Aquinas), and “the deep prison into whose smoky atmos-
phere the demons are cast ” (Alb. Magnus); purgatory‚ a sort of reformatory
school, where the baptized are purged of sins clinging to thern at death; heaven;
and the abodes of the fathers and infants, limbus infantum. The last is the
final dwelling-place of all unbaptized children dying in infancy, where they
abide forever without hope of beatitude‚ without change, and without vision
oi God or physical light.
