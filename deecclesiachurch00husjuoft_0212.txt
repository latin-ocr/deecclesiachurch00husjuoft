158 THE CHURCH

and the apostles appointed for themselves after the Lord's
ascension deacons to be ministers of their episcopate and
of the church‚'’¹—why should it be wondered at if God al-
mighty, putting the pope and his cardinals to death and
giving them also eternal life—in case they merit it—should
allow His church throughout the whole world to wage war
with these same orders now as originally, namely, without
the cardinals‚ and should ordain that the church should be
ruled again as she was ruled by His own indestructible law,
by giving bishops and priests who, by evangelizing and prayer
and the exemplification of good lives, would diligently seed
Christ's sheep. For this office alone was given to Peter by
Christ, as appears in John 21.

Hence Augustine notes, Ep. 141, ad Paulinum [Migne's
ed., xxxiii z 635], how in the apostolic passage, Eph. 4 z 11,
the office of pastor and the office of teacher are joined.
“Pastors,'' he says, “ and teachers whom thou hast appointed
to discern above all the truth, are, Ι think, the same, and
not the pastors one and the teachers another. And so, as
he had spoken previously of pastors, he added teachers that
pastors might understand that teaching—doctrina—belonged
to their office. And, therefore, he did not say, ‘some pas-
tors and some teachers'—the form of speech used in the
former part of the preceding verst÷but ‘some pastors and
teachers,' as if one office were embraced under the two words:
‘some,' he said, ‘pastors and teachers,' '³

Hence, if that which is superfluous be taken away, it
would appear what pope, cardinal or bishop would remain
a true shepherd out of the treasury os the Lord, and per-
haps more would be found useless thieves and robbers rather
than true vicars of the Lord Jesus Christ.

But against what has been said the objection is brought,

¹ Cyprian's text, which Huss is quoting, runs thus: “The deacons should
remember how the Lord chose the apostles‚ that is, the bishops and presbyters,
but after the Lord's ascension, the apostles appointed them as ministers of their
episcopate and the church.''
