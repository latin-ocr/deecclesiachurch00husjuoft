THE CARDINALS 141

spiritual matters, was called by Christ Satan, Peter out of
affectionate love having tried to dissuade him from submit-
ting to the sentence of death, why should not another one,
more opposed to Christ in his life, not be called Satan and
consequently antichrist or antichrist's vicar or antichrist’s
chief minister? Hence, St. Bernard, Com. on Canticles,
says: “Evil has gone out from thy elder judges, who seem
to be ruling the poeple. Alas! alas! O Lord God, for they
were the first to persecute thee who seemed to hold primacy
in thy church and to rule the spiritual princedom. Likewise
all friends are all foes, all clients are all adversaries, all ser-
vants are no peaceful men, all who seek the things which are
their own, they are ministers of Christ and yet the servants
of antichrist.'' See how plainly that holy man brings out
that bad prelates are in pretence friends, servants, and minis-
ters of Christ. But in fact they are the foes of Christ and the
servants of antichrist.

Likewise, Augustine, Com. on John, also Decretum, 8 ε 1
[Nic. Fathers, 7 : 4463 Friedberg, 1 ε 596], pointing out who
are not true shepherds‚ but mercenaries, says: “There are
some superiors in the church about whom the apostle Paul
says: ‘they seek their own things and not the things of Christ.'
What is it, therefore, ‘to seek one's own things'? Not to
love Christ freely, not to seek God for His own sake,l to
follow after temporal comforts, to heap up riches, to hanker
after honors from men. When these are loved by the supe-
rior, and when God is served for such things, whoever he
may be that serves, he is a mercenary and he does not count
himself among the children.'' For about such the Lord also
says: ‘Verily, verily, I say unto you, they received their re-
ward.' Hence the same Augustine says: “That just as Peter,
the apostle, was the type of all good men and especially good
bishops, so Judas represented all bad men, especially bad
priests.''
