ECCLESIASTICAL SUPERIORS 2 19

by the standard of their class—de genere—which words des-
ignate from a moral standpoint the substance or nature of a
good work or an evil. Nevertheless‚ they do not involve the
circumstances which of themselves fix the natures of such
acts as in the class oi virtue or vice, as, for example, giving
alms or putting a man to death. For both of these can be-
come good or evil according to the diversity of their causes
or the purpose of the doer. For to give alms for vainglory
is evil, just as to kill a man by the authority of God, lest
he infect the church‚ is good.l But of another kind are col-
lective works, which from a moral standpoint are called
purely good or bad, such as committing adultery and thiev-
ing, which are of vice, and loving God and our neighbor heart-
ily, which are virtuous. Briefly, as one act is purely good,
such as loving God with the heart, so another act is purely
evil, as is hating God.

Likewise, a thing is good generically which, as it were,
disposes a man to judge and discover that it is good more
than to judge that it is evil, as fasting and giving alms. A
thing is evil generically which, as it were, disposes a man to
judge and discover what may be evil rather than what may
be good. Howbeit‚ the thing may be well done, as the put-
ting a man to death. But a neutral work is such a work
which does not dispose a man to judge and discover what is
good rather than what is evil, as weaving, eating, plough-
ing, or running.

Hence, a work absolutely good holds the first rank, a
work generically good [that is, judged by its class], as it were,
the middle rank, and a neutral work the lowest rank. Ex-
amples of these three are loving God, fasdng, and weaving,
The same applies to their opposites, for a work purely evil,
as is hating God; a work generically evil is putting a man
to death. But the third or neutral work is not counted as
evil, for if it were it would not be neutral. For the name
