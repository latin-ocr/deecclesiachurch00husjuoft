CHAPTER XII

CHRIST THE TRUE ROMAN PONTIFF UPON WHOM
SALVATION DEPENDS

To the honor of our Lord Jesus Christ, wh1ch honor and
also Christ the aforesaid doctors nowhere mention in their
writing‚ this conclusion is proved, namely, “to be subject to
the Roman pontiff is necessary for salvation for every human
being.'' ¹ From this it is clear, that no one can be saved
unless he is meritoriously subject to Jesus Christ. But
Christ is the Roman pontifi, just as he is the head of the
universal church and every particular church. Therefore

things said above and from what is said in I Peter 2 : 25,
“For ye were sometime going astray like sheep but are now
returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls‚'' and
also from Heb. 7 ε 22: “By so much also hath Jesus become
the surety of a better covenant and they indeed have been
made free, many in number, according to the law because

man, because he continueth forever, hath his priesthood un-

most, drawing near through himself 2 to the Lord and always
living to intercede for us. For such a high priest became
us holy, guileless‚ undefiled‚ separated from sinners and made
higher than the heavens‚ who needeth not daily like those

¹ From Bonisace VIII's bull Unam sanctam. The expression in the next
sentence, “meritoriously‚’' refers to the mediaeval doctrine of merit in propor-
tion to our good works.

² Accedens refers the drawing near to Christ. The Vulgate has the plural,
accidentes, those who draw near through Christ.
