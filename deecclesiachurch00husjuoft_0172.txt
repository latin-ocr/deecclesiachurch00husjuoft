118 THE CHURCH

priests preach against the offenses of pestiferous clerics,
therefore has this disagreement arisen, for the reason that
the clergy in imparting to the people the plague of criminal
living and refusing to tolerate the preaching of those who
preach against their plague, which is at variance with the
Gospel and who seek to cure their infection by the Word of
the Lord, has conspired together and desires in malice to sup-
press preaching. But the purpose of the said doctors was
to prove that those who evangelize against the wickedness of
the pestiferous clergy were heretical on the subject of the keys‚
which, with the help of the Lord, during the term of their
liveS‚ they will not prove.
