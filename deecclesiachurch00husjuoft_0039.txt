INTRODUCTION xxxiii

those, not in communion with the visible church, are lost.
The church was looked upon as a tangible, palpable institu-
tion, as much so as the duchy of Spoleto or the kingdom of
F rance. The Schoolman, who carne nearest giving a defini-
tion‚ was Hugo of St. Victor who, in his work on the sacra-
ments, called the holy catholic church the body of Christ
vivified by one Spirit, united in one saith and sanctified. It
is the number of the faithful, the totality of all Christians.l
Thomas Aquinas passed it by except as he discussed the
pope's absolute supremacy. The fourth Lateran indeed
spoke of the church as “the one universal church of the
faithful outside of which there cannot be any salvation''-—
extra quam nullus omnino salvatur—a statement which nar-
rowed the church down to the limits of the Roman communion
in the profession demanded of the Waldenses‚ namely‚ “we
believe with the heart and confess that the one church is
not of the heretics but the holy Roman catholic church out-
side of which no one can be saved.'' ²

In his Rule os Princes and Errors os the Greeks, Thomas
Aquinas gave his assent to Innocent III's assumption claim-
ing for the Roman pontiff plenitude of power and declared
that obedience was due to the Roman church as to the Lord
Jesus himself—cui obediendum est tanquam Domino Deo, J esu.
He used also the words: “subjection to the Roman pontiff
is of necessity to salvation''—subesse romano pontifici est de
necessitate salutis.³

A new period in the history of the conception of the
church opened with Boniface's buu, Unam sanctam, and was
forced by it, the text on which other writers as well as Wy-
elif and Huss comment frequently.⁴ This notorious document
might have been relegated to the archives of innocuous legal
