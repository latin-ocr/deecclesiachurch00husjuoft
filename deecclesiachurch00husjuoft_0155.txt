POWER OF BINDING AND LOOSING 101

ister os the church. Again the minister of the church, the
vicar of Christ, is not able to absolve or to bind, to for-
give sins or to retain them, unless God has done this pre-
viously. This appears from John 15 : 5: “Apart from me ’
ye can do nothing.” That vessel of election knew this, and
so he said: “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to ac-
count anything as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from
God,’' II Cor. 3 ε 5. Therefore‚ if we are not sufficient to
think except as God imparts the thought, how are we suf-
ficient to bind and loose except God have previously loosed
and bound? And this the philosophers recognize when they
say that a second cause can effect nothing without the
coagency of a first cause.

F urther, it is clear that no man may be loosed from sin
or receive the remission of sins, unless God have loosed him or
given him remission. Hence the Baptist says: “A man can
receive nothing except it first be given him from heaven,'’ John
3 ε 27. Hence as an earthly lord first forgives in spirit the sin
committed against himself, before this is announced by him-
self or by another, so it is necessary for God to do. Therefore,
the presbyters are wildly beside themselves who think and say
that they may of their own initiative loose and bind, without
the absolution or binding of Jesus Christ preceding their act.
For loosing and binding are in the first instance the simple
[absolute] act of God. Therefore, the Gospel sayS, “Whatso-
ever is bound on earth shall be bound in heaven,'' but it does
not say that it is bound in heaven at a later time and not
previously.

Hence, the ignorant think that the priest binds and looses
in time first and after him God. It is folly to have this
opinion. But the logicians know well that priority is two-
sold: the one, priority of origin, taken from the material cause,
and the other the priority of dignity, taken from the final
cause. And these two priorities meet at one and the same
time, and in this way the binding and loosing of the church
