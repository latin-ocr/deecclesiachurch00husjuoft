 

THE LAW OF GOD 173

death, the spiritual government of the church chiefly in-
hered. And in this church not the pope but Christ is the
chief ruler who presides over that place, that is, the basilica
or apostolic dignity, and he rules the church which is his
bride. But, if in the pope is discovered a life at variance
with Christ, lived in pride, greed, restless impatience‚ ambi-
tion, and in the flaunting of power and giving preponderance
to his own law over the law of Christ—then is seen the abom-
ination of the desolation of Christ's virtues standing in the
holy place, where it ought not to stand, as Christ said, Mark
13:14. Wherefore‚ if faithful souls should observe any-
where the spiritual state of the church set up, where one head
of a familyl was accustomed to preside over his house, who
graciously received all his servants whom he had invited,
took care of them by warming them, and defended them
by helping them, but if in that same house he should find
that one presides over a condition altogether the opposite,
it would not be wondered at if many were confounded‚ just
as though a traveller wished to be entertained by a true
head of a household‚ a man of large hospitality‚ goodness
and good nature, and of an altogether virtuous life, and
afterward should find a monstrous wild beast which was
wont to tyrannize over the guests by giving them cold com-
fort and by craft, cruelty and avarice and betrayal—the
traveller, entering the house and seeing such an one sitting
in the chair of the good head of the household, would won-
der, be troubled and not a little confounded at his looks.
So the abomination of desolation may be understood in ac-
cord with Zech. 11 2 15: “Take unto thee yet again the in-
struments of a foolish shepherd, for I will raise up a shep-
herd in the land which will not visit those which are cut
off, neither seek those which are scattered nor heal that

which is broken nor feed that which is sound3 but he wiH
eat the fiesh of the fat sheep and will tear their hoofs in
