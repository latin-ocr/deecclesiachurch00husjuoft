102 THE CHURCH

militant is in a sense prior to the binding and loosing of the
church triumphant and vice versa.

But God’s act of binding or loosing is absolutely first.
And it is evident, it would be blasphemy to assert that a
man may remit an offense done to so great a Lord, with the
Lord himself approving the remission. For by the universal
law and practice followed by the Lord, He himself must
loose or bind first, if any vicar looses or binds. And for us
no article of the faith ought to be more certain than the
impossibility of any one of the church militant to absolve or
bind except in so far as he is conformed to the head of the
church, our Lord Jesus Christ.

Hence, the faithful should be on his guard against this
form of statement: “If the pope or any other pretends that
he binds or looses by a particular sign, then by that very
fact the offender is loosed or bound.’' For by conceding
this, they have to concede that the pope is impeccable as is
God, for otherwise he is able to err and to misuse the key of
Christ. And it is certain that as impossible as it is for the
figure of a material key to open anything when the substance
is wanting, so impossible is it for Christ's vicar to open or
shut except as he conforms himself to the key of Christ
which first opens and shuts. For just as Christ the first-
born of many brethren and the first-fruits of them that sleep
was the first to enter the kingdom, so he alone and above
all could have had committed to him the spiritual kingdoml
which was altogether closed from the time our first parents
lied until he himself carne. And the same is to be said in
regard to any opening or closing whatever which pertains
to the heavenly country. And it is plain that every vicar
of Christ, so long as he continues to walk in this world, may
err, even in those things which concern the faith and the
