THE CHURCH WITHOUT POPE 157

presbyter Evagrius, Dist. 93, Legimus [F riedberg, 1 t 328]‚ when
he says: “What does the bishop do, except ordain, that the
presbyter does not do? Nor is the church of the city of Rome
one thing, and the church of the whole world another. And
the church of Gaul and of Britain and Africa and Persia and
the Orient and India and all the barbarous nations adore
one Christ and observe one rule of truth. If authority is
sought‚ the world is greater than the city. Wherever there
may be a bishop, either at Rome, Constantinople or Alex-
andria, the bishop is of the same merit and of the same priest-
hood. The power of riches and the lowliness of poverty makel
the bishop either higher or lower. Besides,'' he says, “all are
successors of the apostles.'’ So we see that the pope and his
cardinals are not the only successors of Christ.

The same is made to appear by Bede who, commenting
on Luke 10 ε 1 [Com. on Luke, Migne's ed., 92 : 461], “The
Lord hath appointed seventy-two others,'' says: “There is
no one who doubts that just as the twelve apostles prefig-
ured the class of bishops, so these seventy-two the class of
presbyters and bore the mark of the second order of the
priesthood.’'² From the things already said it is shown
that others than the pope and cardinals may be given and
found as true successors of the apostles. Inasmuch‚ there-
fore, as by Christ's appointment in the days of the apostles,
two orders of the clergy sufficed for his church, that is, the
deacon and the priest, as the saints say, and also the De-
cretum, 93, Dominus Noster [Friedberg, 1 z 329], where it runs:
“The Lord chose apostles, disciples, bishops and presbyters,

¹ Huss's text omits non and also Rhegium and other citios of whose bishops
Jerome makes mention.

²The number, seventy-two‚ is given by some MSS. and in the Vulgate.
Bede goes on to say that in the first period of the church, as the Scriptures
bear witness. the terms bishop and presbyter were used interchangeably. The
Venerable Bede, d. 735, the first English scholar, wrote commentaries, and οη
many subjects‚ but is more particularly known by his Eccles. H istory, a history
of England from the time of Caesar to 731. Huss as well as Wyclif quote
Bede frequently.
