CHRIST THE ONLY HEAD OF THE CHURCH 33

to have spoken about the real body and the mixed body of
Christ, or about the real body and the simulated body, for,
not only through eternity but nom hypocrites cannot be said
to be with him.’' How plainly does that holy man show that
the reprobate are not truly of Christ's church! To refer to
Augustino again, de Pen„ 4 [Friedberg, 1 : 12 30], he draws the
