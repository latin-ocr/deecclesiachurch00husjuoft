CHAPTER III
ALL CHRISTIANS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH

AGAmST what has already been said the objection is
raised (1) that if the treatment is correct then no reprobate
would be a part of our holy mother, the universal church.
But the consequence is false, for every Christian is a part of
that church‚ as appears from the parable‚ Matt. 13 147:
“The kingdom of heaven is like unto a net cast into the sea
which gathered in all manner of fish.'' On this St. Gregory
in his Homilies [Migne, 76 z 1116] says: “The holy church
is compared to a net cast into the sea because she is com-
mitted to fishers and because every one is drawn up through
her from the waves of this present world to the eternal king-
dom lest they sink in the depths of eternal death.'’ (2) The
falsehood of the treatment is confirmed by Matt. 22 : 2:
“The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a
marriage feast for his son and sent forth his servants to call
them that were bidden to the marriage feast.'' Going out,
they gathered in all whom they found, both good and bad,
and the marriage feast was full of guests. Here Gregory says:
“By the very quality of the guests it is evident that by this
royal marriage the present church is meant, in which the bad
meet with the good, a mixed church made up of a diversity of
children.’' ¹ (3) Itis confirmed by what is said, Matt. 13 : 41,
“The Son of man shall send forth his angels and gather to-
gether out of his kingdom all things that offend and them
that do iniquity”; and (4) by Matt. 5 t 20: “Whoso shall

brings forth to saith, nevertheless she does‘not lead all to the liberty of spiritual
grace, etc.
