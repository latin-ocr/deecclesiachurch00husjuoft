OBEDIENCE TO THE CHURCH ²39

shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require of thy
hand.’' Here Jerome says: “The priest is bound to preach‚
and let him see to it that fear of man does not make him to
keep silence. There is a great difference in the keeping of
the words of God silent for three causes—namely, out of fear,
stupidity or flattery.'' Likewise is this clear from Gregory,
Pastoral Theology, 15 243, sit rector [Nic. Fathers, 2d Ser.,
12:27, Friedberg, 1 :154], where he gives most solemn
proof from many Scripture texts and, among other things,
says: “Indeed it is written that ‘the sound shall be heard
when he [Aaron] enters into the holy place in the presence
of the Lord . . . that he die not' [Ex. 28 : 33-35]. For the
priest, going in or coming out dies if a sound is not heard
from him, because he gets to himself the anger of the hidden
judge, if he goes in without the sound of preaching.'' The
same is clear from St. Isidore, who says, de Summo Bono, III:
“Priests are condemned for the people’s iniquity if they do
not instruct the ignorant or convict sinners.''

When, therefore, in view of what has been said, any one
who has reached the priesthood has accepted as of com-
mandment the office of preacher, it is clear that that com-
mandment ought to be executed, a pretended excommuni-
cation to the contrary notwithstanding.

Likewise for no true catholic ought it to become a matter
of doubt that a man if he be adequately trained in knowl-
edge is more obligated to teach the ignorant, to advise the
uncertain, to punish the unbridled, to remit sins to those
committing injury, than he is to do any works of mercy.
Since, therefore, when he is fitted for the ministry of alms
for the body, he is bound to do these things under pain of
damnation, as appears from Matt. 2 5—-much more when he
is fitted to administer spiritual alms [is he under obligation
to do spiritual ministries]. From this it is evident that
preaching for the priest and giving alms for the rich are
not things intermediate but commandments.
