chapels‚ such as Huss preached in, to be closed. Against
Huss's open protest the archbishop seized two hundred of
Wyclif’s writings and made a bonfire of them in the court-
yard of his palace‚ 1410. After this event, Huss publicly
defended one of Wyclif's writings, the tract on the Trinity.

A second movement which involved Huss in violent con-
troversy and trouble was the change in the charter of the
university, 1409. By this change the Czech element was
given three votes, and the foreign nations reduced from
three to one. Against Huss, the recognized leader of the
movement, was aroused the bitter opposition of the German
population which exercised an influence in the city out of
all proportion to its numbers. In this issue the court party
was on Huss's side, but the hostility of the Germans, so Huss
felt, thenceforth threatened even his very life.

The third cause of trouble for Huss was his attack‚ in
1412, upon the sale of indulgences authorized by John XXIII
to enable him to carry on a crusade against Ladislaus, king
of Naples. Deserted over this issue by most of his intimate
friends at the university‚ Huss nevertheless spoke out as
boldly as Luther did a hundred years later against the un-
holy traffic. He had already refused to obey a citation to
Rome and was now placed under the ban of excommunica-
tion by the curia. This proving ineffective, the city of
Prague was put under the interdict. In the meantime, Huss
had appealed from the apostolic see to Christ himself, as
the just judge and the supreme ruler of the church.1

The interdict meant moral and religious starvation. In
part to avert the calamity of a cessation of divine minis-
tries and heeding the friendly counsel of the king, Wenzel,
Huss withdrew from Prague and spent the next two years,
from the fall of 1412 to October, 1414, in the rural districts
of Bohemia‚ protected by powerful members of the nobility,
