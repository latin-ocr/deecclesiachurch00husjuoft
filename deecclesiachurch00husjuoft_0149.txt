POWER OF BINDING AND LOOSING 95

like Augustine, Enchiridicm [Nic. FatherS, 3 : 247]‚ say, that
free will may be lost through sin and increased through grace.
On this account there is in the church great strife about the
power of bestowment, withdrawal or restrictiori. Neverthe-
less‚ it is known that when God and reason make it neces-
sary for the profit of the church that a thing should be done
by man, then and not otherwise does God give or withdraw
or restrict power of this sort.

Hence, when Christ said to Peter: “1 will give thee the
keys of the kingdom of heaven‚'’ that is the power of binding

not material things, but they are spiritual power and acquain-

this power and knowledge, as we believe, that Christ used the
plural “keys'' For this reason the Master of Sentences, 12 :
18, cap. 2 [Migne's ed., p. 375], says: “He speaks in the

wisdom of discernment and the power of judging‚ whereby
the ecclesiastical judge is bound to receive the worthy and ex-
clude the unworthy from the kingdom.” And it is to be
noted, that to the Trinity alone does it belong to have the
chief power of this kind. And the humanity of Christ alone
has chief subordinate power from within himself, for Christ
is at the same time God and man. Nevertheless‚ prelates of
the church have committed unto them instrumental or min-
isterial power, which is a judicial power, consisting chiefly
of two things, namely‚ the power of knowing how to dis-
criminate, and the power of judging judicially. The former
of these is called in the court of penance the key of the con-
science, reasonably disposing the mind to the exercise of the
second function, that is, the judicial; for no one legally has
