194 THE CHURCH

and time, rebuke should be made when it seems likely to be
useful.

Up to this point it is to be noted that human obedience
is threefold—spiritual, secular and ecclesiastical—spiritual,
which is due purely according to God's law, and under this
kind of obedience Christ and the apostles lived and each
Christian should live. Secular obedience is obedience due
according to the secular code. Ecclesiastical obedience is
obedience according to the regulations of the priests of the
church aside from the express authority of Scripture. The
first kind of obedience always excludes what is of itseli evil,
both on the part of the person giving the command and on
the part of the person obeying. For he who commands ac-
cording to God's law and he who obeys act rightly, and of
both it is said: “Thou shalt do whatsoever the priests the
Levites have taught, according to all I have taught them,'’
Deut. 29 [Deut. 24 : 8].

Here it is affirmed that he who commands ought only
to command things in agreement with the law, and the per-
son obeying ought to the same extent to obey them and
never act contrary to the will of God Almighty. On this Ι
have in another place quoted Augustine‚ Gregory‚ Jerome‚
Chrysostom, Isidore, Bernard and Bede, as well as the
Scripture and the canons. These for the sake of brevity I
will pass. Only let the saying of Isidore be given, 11 ε 3
[Friedberg, 1 : 672]: “He who presides, if he command any-
thing or say anything otherwise than in accordance to God’s
will or what is plainly commanded in Holy Scripture, he
shall be regarded as a false witness of God, or as committing
sacrilege.’'
