THE LAW OF Gon 163

ing except to be trodden under foot of man,' Matt. 5 ε 13‚¹
and he added: “Nor is it fit for the dunghill,’' Luke 14 : 35.
And Judas Iscariot he depended upon little, for he called
him a devil and the son of perdition, John 6 ε 7Ι; 17 ε 12.
Peter he also called Satan, when Peter opposed him, Matt.
16 : 22.

Later on that doctor heaps together many lies against
us. The first lie is that we wish to have the holy Scrip-
tures alone for our judge in such matters. And in this state-
ment he affirms that we would not wish to have for our judge
God‚ the apostles, the holy doctors, or the universal church.
But he draws this lie from a certain disputation in which we
were engaged, when it was said that he would offer Scrip-
ture for his statements and for the reason that we would
not agree to the positions of our opponents. The doctor,
however, ought to know that neither with him nor with any
of his adherents do we agree in matters of saith unless they
ground themselves in Scripture or reason. But revelation Ι
do not expect from them, and if it did perchance come to
them, we would feel that it taught otherwise than the Scrip-
ture teaches.

The second lie that he ascribes to us is that we interpret
holy Scripture according to our heads, that is—as he him-
self and the other doctors allege—that we expound holy
Scripture according to our erroneous understanding or ac-
cording to our pleasure, and in this he charges upon us the
arrogance of wisdom and also heresy, but mendaciously, be-
cause, with God's help, we do not intend to explain Scripture
otherwise than the Holy Spirit requires and than it is ex-
plained by the holy doctors to whom the Holy Spirit gave
understanding. And I could wish that that doctor and all
his colleagues might show which Scripture it is which we

expound ill. Hence, he is the more to be suspected of lying

by the effects or fruits whether the pope and cardinals are the salt of the earth
and the light of the world.
