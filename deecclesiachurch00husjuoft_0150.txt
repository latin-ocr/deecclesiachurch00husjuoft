96 THE CHURCH

the power of pronouncing a definite sentence unless he has
the prior power of discerning in a case in which he is called
upon to discriminate and pronounce sentence.

The first key, therefore, is neither an act nor a state of
knowledge, but the power of antecedent discernment. Con-
sequently‚ all the power of the sacerdotal order, namely, of
being the instrument in opening to man the gate, which is
Christ, or of shutting to an inferior the said kingdom, is the
key of the church given to Peter and to others, as appears from
the Saviour’s words: “Verily I say unto you whatsoever ye
bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye
shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven,’' Matt. 18 : 18.
He also said: “ Receive ye the Holy Spirit. Whosesoever sins
ye forgive they are forgiven unto them3 and whosesoever sins
ye retain they are retained,’' John 20 : 22. To Peter and the
church in him were the words spoken: “ WVhatsoever thou
shalt loose on earth‚'⁷ etc., Matt. 16 : 19.

These words, because of a defect in their understanding‚
frighten many Christians so that they are filled with servile
fear, while others are deceived by them and presume because
of the fulness of power [they are supposed to convey]. T here-
fore, the following things are to be laid down: (1) That the
Saviour's dictum about the virtue of the words is necessary,
because it is not possible for a priest to loose or bind anything,
unless such loosing and binding take place in heaven, not
only in the heavenly realm which also comprises the sublu-
nary world and all things which are therein, but also take
place with the divine approval and the approval of angelic
beings which are heavenly. Hence, it is to be noted, that
guilt inheres in the soul of him who sins mortally and grace
is corrupted or ceases to be, for which reason he who sins mor-
tally is under the debt of eternal damnation, provided he
does not do penance, and, if he persists in this guilt, he is
separated from the companionship of pilgrims in grace. But
in penance there is a remedy, by which guilt is deleted, grace
