266 THE CHURCH

the sentence that the excommunication enj0ined in the proc-
esses is just.

Likewise‚ the doctors say that the processes [court pro-
ceedings] are to be obeyed, especially because in them noth-
ing that is an absolute good is forbidden, nor is anything
enjoined which is an absolute evil, but only things which are
intermediate‚ in which obedience must be rendered in accord-
ance with the teaching of the Gospel and in accordance
with St. Bernard. Therefore the doctors pass sentence that
the commands in the processes are just, among which is the
excommunication of Master John Huss. Therefore‚ these
doctors pass the sentence that the excommunication of Mas-
ter John Huss is just. And they themselves are part of the
clergy in Prague. Therefore, this very conclusion of theirs
confutes these doctors.

Likewise‚ these doctors pronounce judgment that the
excommunication which is enjoined in the processes is a
thing intermediate, a thing between that which is absolutely
good and that which is absolutely evil, and when it is en-
joined in respect to the mode, time, place and person, then
it passes over into a thing absolutely good, because it passes
into an injunction of the pope and prelates. Therefore, the
doctors, in pronouncing such a judgment about the excom-
munication, declare that it is just. Nevertheless‚ in view of
their conclusion, they ought not to pronounce the judgment
that it is just. And this they do, a thing they ought not to
do; yea‚ they do not know what they are doing, for they say
that it is not for the clergy in Prague to pronounce judg-
ment that the excommunication of John Huss is unjust, and
yet they pronounce judgment that it is just. It is certainly
worthy of laughter how doctors of the law agree to this con-
clusion, doctors who pronounce judgment on the decrees,
decretals and processes [court proceedings] whether they are
just or justly given or by just men, when they ought by
reasonable methods to expound the decrees and the decretals
