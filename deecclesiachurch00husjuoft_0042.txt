xxxvi IN TRODUCTION

Luther learned directly from Huss, but Luther’s assertions
show that he not only took Huss under his protection, but
that he was confirmed in his opposition to the pope by his re-
gard for Huss and by his writings. Not to quote again what
I have quoted in another place, Luther said: “I rejoice that
Huss, a true martyr, is rising before this, our century, that
is to be properly canonized even if the papists are broken
to pieces. Oh! that my name were worthy to be associated
with such a man.¹

Luther's definition of the church is embodied in the Augs-
burg Confession. It was due to Luther and Zwingli that the
terms visible and invisible were used to designate the true
church from the body of the baptized.2

True to the mediaeval conception and only six months
before the naih‘ng up of the XCV Theses, Leo X confirmed
Boniface's Unam sanctam, and in reply to Luther Prierias
declared the church to be in essence the community of be-
lievers but virtually the Roman church and the Roman pon-
tifi-ecclesia universalis essentialiter est convocatio credentium,
virtualiter ecclesia Romana et pontifex maximus. The catholic
polemic of the seventeenth century, with Bellarmine at its
head, made the rule of the papacy of the essence of the defini-
tion of the church. He expressly repudiated as heretical the
definition of Wyclif‚ Huss and Calvin.³ Still true to the
mediaeval idea, Pius IX, in 1873, in a communication ad-
dressed to the German emperor, William I, declared that all
the baptized are in some sense subject to the Roman pontifi‘.⁴

Several matters in Huss’s treatment call for passing note.

¹ Letter to Otto Brunsels, 1524, who edited some of Huss's writings‚ 1524.
See Mon.‚ 1 : 423.

² In his Com. on Galatians, Luther spoke of the church invisible. est in-
visibilis habitans in Spiritu, etc., and Zwingli seems to have been the first to
use both terms, in his Expos. fidei, 1531—est autem eccles. aut visibilis aut in-
visibilis. The XXXIX Articlffi use the term invisible. Schwane, Dogmen-
gesch„ p. 510, says: “Huss rejected the definition that the church is a visible
community of believers in Christ.”
