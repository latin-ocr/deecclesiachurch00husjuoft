262 THE CHURCH

rejoice, why not much more in the second? If he employs
a guardian in the first case, why not in the second?

Nor is there anything to conflict in that saying of St.
Augustine‚ de conflictu virtutum et vitiorum [Migne, 40 : 1094] : ¹
“What sort of men they ought to be who rule is not a ques-
tion to be discussed by subjects.'’ This is true and evident‚
that they ought not to discuss rashly what sort of men they
ought to be, nevertheless, reason dictates to them that they
who rule ought to be good, that they ought not to live in
excess and, if they live badly, subjects ought to take heed
and to beware of their evil works in advance. Hence Au-
gustine says: “If human rule is to be obeyed, it is necessary
that we be subject to divine government,2 for Christ himself
says, ‘He who heareth you, heareth me, and he that despis-
eth you, despiseth me.'” And, further on, Augustine adds:
“Nevertheless, because he foresees that not all will in the
future be of this kind, he took all kinds of subjects into the
company of his disciples and said, admonishing them in ad-
vance, ‘The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat ; what-
soever things they say to you, these do, but what they do,
do not ye.' '' And it is clear that, with the zeal of a good pur-
pose, subjects should discuss the manner of life of their su-
periors or think of it, so that, if the superiors are good, the
subjects may imitate them3 if evil, they follow not their works, ‘
but in an humble spirit pray for them and take heed when
they command good things. Otherwise, unless they discuss,
they will fall with the blind leader into the hole, and easily
it may happen that they will worship antichrist as God,
and, like the Jewish people who followed their leaders—
praelatis—-conspire against Christ the Lord.

¹ The treatise was falsely ascribed to Augustine.

² Huss’s text must be wrong or Huss is drawing an inference in his own
language. The original treatise has si obtemperandum Domini est imperio hu-

mano subdi necesse est magisterio. If the Lord’s rule is to be obeyed, subjec-
tion to human government is necessary. Romans 13 z 1—2 is quoted.
