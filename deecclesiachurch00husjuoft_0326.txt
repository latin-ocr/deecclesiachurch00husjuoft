272 THE CHURCH

a drunkard or an extortioner, with such an one no not to eat‚'’
Ι Cor. 5:11: “Likewise it must be known that every
one sinning mortally is excommunicated of God‚ in accord-
ance with that Psahn, ‘Cursed are those who depart from
thy commandments‚' and I Cor. 16 : 22, ‘If any man love
not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema.’ '’ And al-
though this excommunication is called minor because it is
not pronounced solemnly in public by a prelate, neverthe-
less I fear it more than the maJ‘or excommunication, with
which the prelates now assail me. But, besides, I fear the
greatest excommunication more still with which the high
priest‚ sitting in the sight of all the angels and men, will ex-
communicate the damned from participation in eternal bless-
edness, as he said: “ Go,l ye cursed into the eternal fire which
is prepared for the devil and his angels‚'' Matt. 2 5 z 41. Of
this excommunication the judge ought to think and he ought
to beware lest he excommunicate unjustly. For whoever
excommunicates another for temporal gain or chiefly for his
own honor or to revenge an injury against himself or with-
out any known cause of criminal offence this man excom-
municates himself. For he ought to excommunicate him
whom God excommunicates, for criminal offence which he
knows [the possible offender] has committed and after the
third warning and out of love, for the honor of God and
for the salvation of the man whom he excommunicates and
also for the advantage of others that they may fear and
that he [the offender] do not infect them. So Paul did when,
writing to the Corinthians, he charged them to cast out the
public fornicator lest he should infect others and also that
his soul might be saved, I Cor. 5 : 5.

Now, these things being considered, the faithful should
know how many prelates, clergy and laity are excommuni-
cated of God; for all who depart from the Lord's command-
ments are excommunicated, and also how many excommuni-
