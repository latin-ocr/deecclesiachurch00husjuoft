questions which had seemed to be forever settled before
Boniface issued his bull. The discussions were participated
in by a class of rnen of whom Konrad of Gelnhausen was
one of the very first, and by Wyclif followed by Huss who
constitute a much more advanced group. The opinions of
the former group found expression in the Reformatory coun-
cils, notably the council of Constance. The opinions of the
latter involved an ecclesiastical revolution and led straight
forward to the Protestant Reformation.

The opening clause of Boniface’s bull asserting the unity
of the church‚ Wyclii and Huss both accepted, but they put
upon it another interpretation from that intended by Boni-
face. The unity was not in the apostolic see but in predes-
tinating grace as manifeng itself in the exercise of the
Christian virtues. The other clauses they wholly repudiated‚
namely the clause that to the church is given both swords
and the clause that it is altogether necessary for salvation
that every creature be subject to the Roman pontiff. The
latter repeats the very language of Thomas Aquinas. In re-
nouncing these two propositions, Wyclif and Huss set them-
selves against the fabric of the mediaeval system.

It was Huss's merit that he kept open the subject of
the church by his death and this treatise. He passed Wyclif’s
views on to a later time, and his volume was the avenue for
their transmission. Huss's tenets and his memory, embodied
in the Christian dissenters known as “the Bohemians‚'' were
a constant source of interest and of controversy down to the
age of Luther. At the close of the fifteenth century, Wessel
exclaimed: “The church cannot err, but what is the church?
It is the communion of the saints to which all true believers
belong who are bound together by one saith, one love, one
hope.'' The definition of the nature and the functions of
the church was awaiting settlement, and the staggering blow
to Boniface VIII’s arrogance was given by the Reformation.

In view of our authorities, it would be false to say that
