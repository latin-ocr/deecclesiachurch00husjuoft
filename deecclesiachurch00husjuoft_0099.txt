GOOD AND BAD IN THE CHURCH 45

Hence, John the Baptist aptly says that “he will purge,’'
that is, on the day of judgment, “his threshing-floor,'' that is,
holy church, and “gather the wheat into the garner,'' namely,
the predestinate into the heavenly country ; but “the chaff,''
namely, the reprobate, “he will burn with fire unqueneh-

from the unrighteous, the good from the wicked‚ the strait
from the crooked. The good he will place at his right hand,

a sentence, unending and immutable, of righteous and eternal
judgment, and all the wicked will go into eternal burning, but
the righteous into life eternal. The wicked will always be
burning with the devil, the righteous be reigning without
end [with Christ].⁷'¹ Thus far Augustine. From the ex-
position οἱ the saints it is clear how in Christ’s parables the
reprobate are symbolized by the bad fishes, by the bad guests
at the wedding, by the man not clad in a wedding-garment
at the feast, by the chaff, by the tares, by the bad seed, by the
evil tree, by the foolish virgins, and by the goats. On the
other hand, in an opposite way, the predestinate are sym-
