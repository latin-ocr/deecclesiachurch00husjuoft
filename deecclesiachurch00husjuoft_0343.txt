 

SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT 289

I will under no circumstances despise your youth or the be-
ginnings of your ecclesiastical honor, for I am ready to learn,
an old man from a young, a bishop of so many years' experi-
ence from my colleague not yet a little year old in his office
—I am ready to learn how Ι may give a good reason to God
or men, if we punish by spiritual punishment innocent souls
for another's offence which they do not derive from Adam,
in whom all have sinned. For, although Clazianus‚ a son,
drew from his parents the corruption of the first man—which
is to be expiated in the sacred font of baptism—nevertheless,
who doubts that some of the sin which his father, after be-

household was anathematized, should, in passing out of the
body, perish without baptism, the death of innumerable
bodies, if innocent men are to be violently drawn from the
church and put to death, is not to be compared with this
damning injury. If, therefore, thou art able to give a reason
for this event, would that thou wouldst honor us in writing

your acting in inconsiderate excitement of mind. Hence, if
thou shouldst be asked, thou wouldst not be able to present
a right reply.’' Thus much Augustine.

From these things Gratian draws the following conclu-

person is illegally excommunicated who is excommunicated for
the sin of another.'' And back of them they have no reason
whatever wh0, for the sin of a single person, lay the sen-
tence of excommunication upon an entire family. An illegal
excommunication, however, hurts not the person cited, but
only the person who excommunicates. Hence it is to be
noted that the Gloss of the Decretum, summarizing the chap-
