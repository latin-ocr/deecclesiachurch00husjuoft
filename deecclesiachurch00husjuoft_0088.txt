34 THE CHURCH

did not have perseverance, they were not Christ's true dis-
ciples, and so they were not true children of God, although
for a time they seemed to be so and were called so. There-
fore, we call those the elect, disciples of Christ and God’s
children, and they are to be called children whom we see liv-
ing regenerate and pious lives. And then they truly are what
they are called when they abide in that on account of which
they were so called [which is the ground of their receiving
these names]. But if they have not the gift of perseverance,
that is, do not abide in that on account of which they started
out to be, then they are not truly called on account of that
which they are caHed [for that which gives them their name],

known what they will be in the future, that is, evil persons
who have proceeded from being good'’ [that is, from being by

them eternal life and no one shall pluck them out of my hand.''
And later Christ, the best of teachers‚ proves by the greatness
os God’s gift, which is the Holy Spirit, that no one is able to
do this, because his Father is almighty‚ and from his hand
no one is able to pluck anything. But, because Christ and
his F ather are one with the Holy Spirit—who is Christ’s gift,
by whom the church is knit together with him—therefore,
no one is able to pluck his sheep out of his hand. For he him-
