and examine the proceedings, whether they are just or un-
just, and to advise others, when the emergency arises, whether
processes ought to be admitted and held or whether they
ought not be admitted and held3 or whether it is lawful to
take appeal from them. This is clear, because the doctors
have irrationally shut themselves off on both sides from a
reasonable judgment.

But how the processes fuhninated against me are null
and erroneous, the Venerable Master John de Jesenicz, doctor
of canon law, showed most clearly by a public discussion
and in a decision in the university of Bologna. And because,
as I have said, processes of this kind chiefly enjoin excom-
munication, suspension and interdict, for that reason I will
say something about them briefly.

Let it be first noted that excommunication means placing
outside of communication, 11 : 3, Nihil. and cap. Canonica
[Friedberg, 1 : 653, 674]; 29 : 1, Viduas [Friedberg, 1 : 1091];
24 ε 3 [Friedberg, 1 : 988]; 11 : 3, Omnis Christianus [Fried-

namely‚ communication or communion—inasmuch as by the
opposite os what is good everything good is understood, so
also of evil and its opposite—therefore it is to be noted that
communication or good communion is threefold. The first
is the participation of divine grace, which makes gracious.
This the apostle wishes for the Corinthians, when he says:
“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
and the communication of the Holy Spirit be with you all‚”
Π Cor. 13 : 13. This communication is the communion of
the saints, who are Christ's mystical body, the body of which
Christ is the head, and this communion we believe when
we say: “I believe the communion of saints.'’ The second
communication or communion is the participation in the
sacraments. “There is one Lord, one saith, one baptism,''
Eph. 4 : 5. It is especially taken, however, for the partici-
