192 THE CHURCH

counsels are for the perfect which obligate above what is
commonly required by reason and everywhere and always un-
der pain of mortal sin. And that they may shun the occasion
of sin, counsels advise thern as friends. Hence, if a saint
should make a divine counsel an occasion of falling from his
height into mortal sin—that would be by the breaking of
the first command and not by a refusal to obey the divine
counsel. But in the heavenly country where the danger and
occasion oi sin do not exist, the counsel is not spoken of in
this way. For in the heavenly country there is no voluntary
poverty nor is there any savor of indigence. This Christ
counselled when he said, Matt. 19 : 21: “If thou wilt be per-
fect, go and sell alll that thou hast.''

The second obedience is by co-operative submission to a
superior, of which it is said, “ If any one would come after me,

And in heaven there is no struggling against chastity‚ of which
it is said: “There are eunuchs who have made themselves eu-
nuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake‚'' Matt. 19 ε 12. Nor
is there found there any retaliation against adversaries, of which
it is said: “Do good to them which hate you,'’ Matt. 5 : 44.
Nor is there any patient endurance of those who smite vio—
lently, of which it is said: “Whosoever shall smite thee on
the right cheek, turn to him the other also,'' Matt. 5 : 39.
Nor are there any supererogatory works of mercy there, about
which it is said, “Give to every one that asketh of thee‚”
Luke 6 : 30; nor any refraining from words and oaths‚ of
which it is written: “For every idle word which men shall
speak they shall give account in the day of judgment,''
Matt. 12 : 36, and, “1 say unto you, swear not at all,'' Matt.
5 : 33. Nor will there be left the occasion to commit sin,
of which it is said: “If thine eye cause thee to stumble, or
foot, or hand, pluck it out and cut it off and cast it from
thee‚” Matt. 5 : 29. Nor will there be any easement oi ac-
