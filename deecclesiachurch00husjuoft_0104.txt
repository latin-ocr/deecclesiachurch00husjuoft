50 THE CHURCH

member of the church while in fact he is not, his saith or his
believing will be false. Therefore, a pastor is expected, by
giving instruction in works that are more virtuous, to in-
fluence those under him to believe that he is such. Hence,
if an inferior does not discern the works oi his superior to be
virtuous‚ he is not bound to believe that he is a member of
the church by the law of present righteousness, or to believe
with godly fear and conditionally that he is such genuinely,
simpliciter, namely by virtue of predestination. And, if he
certainly knows his sin, then he ought to conclude from his
works that at that time he is not righteous but an enemy of
Jesus Christ. ,And so it is clear that the third conclusion is
false. For there is no confusion in the church militant, by
reason of the fact that without revelation we do not know
certainly who are members of Christ's mystical body on earth.

Up to this point the objection is: Seeing that grace makes
sons of the church, just so sin makes members of the devil
and also unbelievers, it is clear that a man may become a
member of the church after being an unbeliever, just as from
being a member of the church one may become a member
of the devil. For who doubts that Iscariot, when he was a
true apostle, was not also a member of the church?¹ Even
so Paul, when he was a blasphemer, was separate from
holy mother church. What is here said is said because the
church is conceived of in a true sense or in a nominal sense—-
in the true sense she is, as has been said, identical with the
predestinate3 in the nominal sense the church is called the

¹ Huss is constantly using Judas as an example of how a prescitus, a repro-
bate, may be a pope or a bishop, having present righteousness, it may be, but
not among the elect. Judas was legitimately elected, as Christ says, John 6 ε 70,
and yet he had a devil. So a pope may well be elected according to the ritual,
and yet be of the lost, Replies to Palecz and Stanislaus, M on.‚ 322, 323, 339,
340, etc. In his Com. on Peter the Lombard, Huss says, p. 188: “In truth.
Judas Iscarioth wanted to be a bishop, and it pleased God to choose him to the
episcopate. But what good did he get thereby? Certainly he lost his episco-
pate because he committed simony3 and he gave himself up body and soul to
damnation because he would not conform his will to the will of God.”
