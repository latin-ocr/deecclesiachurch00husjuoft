2 5 2 THE CHURCH

Likewise, if the pope of his own motion should command
that any one accept a bishopric who was incompetent on
account of his inexperience of the language of the people
he was to rule, would he have to obey by accepting? It
is evident he would not. Similarly, it is evident that the
people would not have to accept him just as they would
not want the pope to put over them a shepherd of sows or
goats—a pastor who would be of no account to feed those
flocks.

And it is clear, that Christ’s faithful disciple ought to
look back to the first exemplar, Christ himself, and listen
to a prelate as far as he teaches Christ’s law, things reason-
able, things to edification, and things lawful for the subject,
for Cyprian, God's glorious martyr, says: Decretum, Dist. 8
[F riedberg, 1 : 15]: “If Christ alone is to be hearkened to,
then we ought not to listen to what any one before us may
have thought ought to be done, but what Christ, who is be-
fore all, did.'’ This soundest of rules antichrist's satraps
lay aside, who say that disobedience to papal statutes is to
be punished most severely, and so Christ with his law is
put aside. Hence, it being laid down that obedience is due
to the pope and prelates in all things neutral‚ the pope, in
treating the law of Christ as difficult to understand, may de-
cree that no Christian should do any work that is neutral‚
except such works as he himself approves and ratifies, and
consequently he may ordain that his satraps cite any per-
sons whatsoever to appear and answer at his tribuna13 and
so they are able to worry the people out till they make a
promise, and mulct the people as they do in absolutions, in
reservations and in dispensations.

And, as is believed, they would practise this more abun-
dantly if they did not fear that the people, perceiving their
subtilty, would rebel. For now God is enlightening the
people that they be not beguiled from Christ's paths. For
Daniel prophesied, saying: “And arms [forces] shall stand
