188 THE CHURCH

the holy city and to a very high mountain, and Christ in a
most virtuous way consented to this and fulfilled the devil's
will. And so in view of this distinction, it is to be said that
to obey is to truly fulfil another's will, and for this reason
obedience always involves the relation of one to another.
But this is not the case with other virtues, as for example,
continence and temperance.

From these things it is gathered that obedience, like
humility, is of three kinds: namely, of the greater to the
less—which is the highest form of obedience3—of an equal to
an equal—which is the intermediate form;——and of the less
to the greater—which is the lowest form. To the last the
first definition of obedience applies—namely, that obedience
is the subjection of one's own will to the will of a superior
in things lawful and right. And it may be defined thus:
obedience is an act of the will of a rational creature by vir-
tue of which he voluntarily and intelligently submits him-
self to his superior: and such obedience is related to what
is good, just as disobedience is related to what is evil. In
both cases, however, it pertains to the rational creature and
his subjection. And secondIy, it refers fundamentally to ac-
tivity, suffering, silence or any other activity of this sort to
which the command is directed.

Hence, as all sin is disobedience and as disobedience is
related to sin, and as every good man obeys God, so every
sinner is disobedient. But obedience may be in the under-
standing and the will--in the understanding, which discerns
that obedience ought to be rendered in given cases; and in
the will, which yields consent to him who commands. But
its results are shown in certain powers within and in an ex·
ternal effect. And, because there is found in Scripture good
obedience and evil disobedience, it is clear what the good is;
and of the evil it was said to Adam, Gen. 3 : 17: “Because
thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife rather than
unto my voice, cursed is the ground for thy sake.'’ It is
