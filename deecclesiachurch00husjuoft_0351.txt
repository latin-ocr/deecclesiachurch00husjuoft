SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT 297

And if, perchance, the doctors should say that in their
statement they mean by “the fathers of the fathers” the
holy prophets or the apostles or the later saints, then would
they be able to give their express writings against which no
one would dare to rebel. And their urgency would cease
which breaks down argument and reasoning‚ when they say
that in the proceedings, following “the method of the church

And it is wonderful how, in view of the Jews, who
denied Christ to be God and so his whole law, they did not
impose the interdict or in view of open simoniacs who
are the chief heretics, and by writings of the apostles and
other saints cursed, excommunicated, suspended and inter-
