92 THE CHURCH

God is ruled according to the law of natural things or of
fortune. So every man is seen to have a double power; for
every man ought to have the power over the movements of
his members‚ and therefore has the power of walking in
grace, so also the spiritual power has manifold subdivisions,
for there is one power of orders and another common to all.
The power of orders is called the spiritual power. This is
that which the clergy has to administer the sacraments of
the church that the clergy may profit itself and the laity,
and such power is the power of consecrating the mass, ab-
solving and performing the other sacramental acts—sacra-
mentalia. For the power of consecrating the mass exists
of itself and immediately, that the priest may consecrate just
as dispositions of moral virtue are ordained because of acts
better than the dispositions. And as the priest, in order
that he may consecrate worthily, is guided as to the gifts of
grace, the above description holds.

But the spiritual power, which is common, is the power
which every priest¹ has in doing spiritual works whether in
his own person or among otherS, and about these the verse
reminds us:

Doce, consule, castiga, solare, remitte, ser, ora.

Teach, counsel, punish, console, remit, bear, pray.²

For as many as received Christ by saith to these hath
he given the power to become the sons of God, so that they
may guide themselves and their brethren in the way of their
Father Christ, and by rebuking in love as Christ said: “Ii
thy brother sin against thee, go show him his fault between
thee and him alone,'' Matt. 18 t 15.

¹ Plebanus, the term common in the M. A. for the parish priest.

² The seven spiritual gifts of mercy, namely‚ teach the ignorant, direct the
doubting, reprove the erring‚ console the sorrowing, forgive those indebted to
thee, bear the infirmities of others, pray for all—in opposition to the seven
bodily works of mercy: Visito, poto, cibo, redimo. tego, colligo, condo, namely‚ I
visit the sick, give drink to the thirsty‚ seed the hungry, release the impris-
oned, clothe the naked, care for the manger, bury the dead. See Huss, Super
IV. Sent., p. 596.
