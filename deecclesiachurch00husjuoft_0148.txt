94 THE CHURCH

into hell, and this is in accord with the rule of St. Gregory
and other saints: “The higher the position the deeper the
fall.''

And it is to be noted, that power now means absolutely
the ability to regulate and rule and now collectively such
ability through authoritative notification and announcement.
And when these senses are equally known, it is evident, there
is nothing contradictory in the principles that there is no
power but of God and yet to give power from God‚ that is,
make an authoritative announcement before the church that a
created being has from God power of this sort. Indeed such
a bestowal, so far as part of it is concerned‚ is given by man
but not unless God primarily authorizes it. And from this
we may further understand that power is not relaxed or stiff-
ened‚ increased or diminished, so far as its essence goes, but
only in respect to the exercise of the act which proceeds from
the power itself. And this exercise ought only to be used
when a reasonable ground exists for it from the side of God.
This meaning is set forth in Decretum 24 : 1, Miramur [Fried-
berg, 1 : 981]‚ which says: “The official power is one thing,
the exercise of it another. And official power is for the most
part held in restraint in the case of monks and of others, such
as those under suspension, who are inhibited from minister-
ing, though the power itself is not taken away from them.''¹
In like manner it is conceded that the natural power, which
is free will, may now be relaxed by grace and now tightened
[i. e., increased and lessened]. And in this way the seeming
discordances of the doctors which arise by ambiguity of lan-
guage are solved, some of whom, as Anselm, say, “that free
will cannot be lost or increased or diminished,'' while others,

¹ In regard to the bishop, Thomas Aquinas made the distinction between
the power—potestas—of doing episcopal acts and jurisdiction. Even a bishop
who becomes schismatic or heretic retains the former, but loses the latter.
Summa Supplem.‚ 39 : 2 [Migne‚ 4 ε 10651. The problem of the validity of acts
done by priests who have become schismatic or heretic was so difficult that
Peter the Lombard and Gratian thought it well-nigh if not altogether insoluble.
