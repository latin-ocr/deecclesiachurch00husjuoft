1 26 THE CHURCH

pope, together with his cardinals, alone the Roman church,
when they say that they believe just as the Roman church
believes and not otherwise, the pope being the head of this
Roman church and the cardinals the body. In these ways
only, so far as I can see, do the doctors designate the church
in their writing.

I assume that the pope stands for that spiritual bishop
who, in the highest way and in the most similar way, occu-
pies the place of Christ, just as Peter did after the ascen-
sion. But if any person whatsoever is to be called pope—
whom the Western church accepts as Roman bishop—ap-
pointed to decide as the final court ecclesiastical cases and to
teach the faithful whatever he wishes, then there is an abuse
of the term, because according to this view, it would be nec-
essary in cases to concede that the most unlettered layman
or a female, or a heretic and antichrist, may be pope. This
is plain, for Constantine II, an unlettered layman, was sud-
denly ordained a priest and through ambition made pope
and then was deposed and all the things which he ordained
were declared invalid, about A. D. 707.l And the same is
plain from the case of Gregory, who was unlettered and con-
secrated another in addition to himself. And as the people
were displeased with the act, a third pope was superinduced.
T hen these quarrelling among themselves, the emperor came
to Rome and elected another as sole pope.2 As for a female,

¹Constantine II, 767-768—n0t 707—was elected through the influence of
his brother Toto, duke of Nepi. He was rushed through the various grades of
ordination and then forced out of the papal chair by a military insurrecffion,
thrown into prison, and blinded. Huss often cites his case. M on., 1 : 342, etc.

² Huss seems to refer to Gregory VI, 104 5—1046 (see also Reply to Stanislaus,
M on„ 1 : 342), although a part of his statement cannot be verified. Gregory
bought the papacy from the flagitious Benedict IX for one thousand or, accord-
ing to another account, two thousand pounds silver. There were then three
popes, Benedict IX, Sylvester III, and Gregory, all three elected by the Roman
people. At the synod of Sutri, 1046, two of these popes were deposed and
Gregory abdicated and, at the instance of the Emperor Henry III, the bishop
of Bamberg was elected and took the name Clement ΙΙ. Gregory was taken
to Germany as a prisoner and died about 1048.
