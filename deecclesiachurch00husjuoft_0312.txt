258 THE CHURCH

Likewise as Bernard in his letter to the monk Adam says
that things which are intermediatffimay equally well or
equally badly be either commanded or prohibited. Therefore,
when a superior commands or forbids Wrongly, and when the
subject knows that he has commanded or forbidden wrongly,
he ought by the law 01 1ον6 to tell the subject his fault as a
brother because when in so commanding or forbidding he sins
against God and his brother. This appears by that rule of
Christ: “If thy brother sin against thee, go and 1611 him his
fault between thee and him alone‚'' Matt. 18 215. Nor is
there any objection to this that he who is superIOr in virtue
should tell one inferior in his living his fault, howbeit the latter
be the superior in rank, 101 otherwise this law 01 Christ would
perish‚ which ordains that every Christian prelate‚ when he has
sinned, should be corrected by another. For the law speaks to
all men alike when it says: “If thy brother sin against thee,
go and tell him his fault.’' But 11, 10 make an impossible
suppositi0n‚ Christ had sinned, he would inasmuch as he
was our brother, Heb. 2 ε 17-19, have had to be corrected
by the church. Hence he indicated this, when he said to
the multitudes: “Which 01 you convicteth me 01 sin?''
John 8 ε 46.

For this reason the church in the person 01 our Saviour
aptly sings: “O my people, what have I done to thee? or
how have I comforted thee? Answer me‚’'—namely, by a
reproach. And Isaiah, 1 ε 17, says: “ Cease to do evil, 163111 10
(10 well. Seek justice, relieve the oppressed‚ judge the father-
less, plead 101 1116 widow‚ and come and let us reason 10-
gether, saith the Lord.'’ Therefore, it is clear that every way-
faring man ought to have his faults told him by his brother,
for otherwise the law 01 Christ would be wanting in provid-

an utter inconsistency, as in his de Eccles„ p. 211. The imaginary characters,
Peter, Paul, and Linus, are used somewhat in the same way as Richard Roe
and John Doe. Linus is brought in as a judge, being chosen because he
belonged to the second generation of presbyters or bishops. See Wyclif, de
domin. cia, pp. 38, 39, for a similar use of Peter, Paul, and Linus to prove the
inconsistency 01 making natural dominion, as opposed to civil dominion, ex-
cmpt from spiritual laws.
