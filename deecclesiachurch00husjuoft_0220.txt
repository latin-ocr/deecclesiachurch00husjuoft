166 THE CHURCH

wish to instruct them [the convocation] nor pronounce judg-
ment upon the pope’s bulls, and interpret them. But in
corners you have written differently, and especially have I
heard Palecz say about the articles which were handed to
him by the pope’s legates that they contained plain errors
evident to the eye, which articles, nevertheless, were taken
from the bull and were handed out to the preachers by these
legates as the first deputies under the authority of the pope
to be promulgated. Hence, as Ι have heard, the preacher,
Master Briccius, in their lecture-room said to those masters
that he would rather die than announce those articles. But
when Palecz receded and was followed by others, Briccius
also receded, for letters from the lord king frightened them,
which letters the legates used for their financial support-
subsidium.

(3) Lyra deduces from the aforesaid Scripture of the
Lord that if judges say what is false or plainly fall away
from God's law they are not to be heard, because God said,
as I have quoted: “Thou shalt not follow the multitude to
do evil; neither shalt thou acquiesce in the judgment of the
many to depart from the truth'' [Ex. 23 : 2]. How, there-
fore, can we be bound contrary to that most holy mandate
of God to follow the multitude which the doctors gathered
together and led to the city hall that they might overeome
by fright those whom they were not able to overeome by
Scripture or reason? The priests, scribes and Pharisees did
not dare to go into the praetorium and accuse Jesus for fear
of being polluted. But these, when the scribes and Phar-
isees and elders of the people were assembled, gladly went
in and one of them, named PalecZ, read, while all listened,
the words of Deut. 17 : 8—12: “But that man that doeth
presumptuously, not willing to obey the judge's decree, even

the sale of the indulgences and declared the pope's bull to his legates was full
of evident errors. For the bulls and Huss's treatise‚ M on., 1 : 212-23 5, see
Schaff: John Huss, p. 111 sq„ 116—122.
