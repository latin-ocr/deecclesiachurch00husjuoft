152 THE CHURCH

thy grant because, when I was Roman bishop, Ι had already
forsaken all and did not crave from Nero dominion over Rome;
nor do Ι stand in need of it. And I see that it greatly hurts
my descendants, for it hinders them in the preaching of the
Gospel and in salutary prayer and in the performance of God's
counsels and commandments and makes many of them proud
and arrogant. Since, therefore, the good—optimus—-God is
able to take away the grant—privilegium——made by those em-
perors and to bring His church back to a state where pontiffs
are on a parity, even as it was before the donation—it follows,
that God is able to give to His church other true successors
than the pope and the cardinals that they may minister even
as did the holy apostles.

But against this the objection is brought: “The pope
has this very appointment from the Lord,'' as the Decretum
states, Dist. 22 [Friedberg, 1 ς 73], where Pope Anacletus
says: “The holy Roman church obtained the primacy not
from the apostles but from the Lord himself.” From this
it follows, that the pope was not appointed to his high office
by the emperor or man but immediately by God. And this

also from the testimony of doctors where they treat of the
pope's authority.

pope, Anacletus, understood by the holy Roman church not

and the other saints who dwelt in that place. For this rea-
son, in this same decretal, he says, that Peter and Paul were
associates in the city of Rome, wherefore it is said figura-
tively that he obtained the primacy.

In regard to the second statement it is to be laid down that
he is speaking about the primacy over men from God’s stand-
point, by virtue of the primacy of virtues and in view of the
edification of the church and not about a primacy of tem-
poral riches or human glory—a primacy which the apostles
