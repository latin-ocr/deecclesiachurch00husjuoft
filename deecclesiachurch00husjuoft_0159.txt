 

POWER OF BINDING AND LOOSING 105

Nor, secondly, could he loose one who would not repent, and
so he said to Simon Magus: “Repent, therefore, of this
thy wickedness and pray the Lord if perhaps it may be sor-
given you,'' Acts 8 : 22. Thirdly, Peter had no power to
loose the marriage bond, for the Saviour said: “What God
hath joined together, let not man put asunder,'’ Matt. 19 : 6.
And fourthly, he was not able to absolve Judas from sin,
because the Saviour said: “Not one of them perished but the
son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,’'
John 17 : 12.

Therefore, if Peter in virtue of that saying of Christ,
“Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven,'' had presumed to have power to loose in any of
the four cases just adduced, would they have been loosed
in heaven? Certainly not! For the will of God would have
opposed it in the case of the Scriptures, marriage, Judas,
and in the case of the one refusing in his pertinacity to re-
pent. Therefore, it does not follow that the vicar, who
thinks that he is able to loose or to bind whomsoever he
chooses, really does it. On this point, St. Augustine, de
vera et salsa Penitentia,¹ speaks, when he says: “God, who
had already raised up Lazarus from the grave, offered Laza-
rus to the disciples that they might loose him,2 thereby show-
ing the power of loosing imparted to priests: and God said,
‘Whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven,'
that is, I, God, and all the ranks of the heavenly army and
all the saints who give praise in that heavenly glory join
with you in confirming those whom ye bind and loose. He did
not say, ‘whom ye think ye bind and loose, but those to-
wards whom ye exercise works of righteousness or mercy.
But your other works done towards sinners I do not recog-

Works. It is quoted by Gratian and Peter the Lombard as Augustine’s. That
the work was not from Augustine’s hand, Erasmus showed.

of St. Victor also uses Lazarus, Migne, 196 : 1166.
