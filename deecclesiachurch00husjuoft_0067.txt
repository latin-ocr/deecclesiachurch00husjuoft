THE ONE UNIVERSAL CHURCH 13

But this universal church is a virgin, the bride of Christ
—who is a virgin—from whom as from a true mother we are
spiritually born. A virgin, I say, all beautiful and in whom
there is no spot [Cant. 4 : 7.], “having neither spot nor
wrinkle'' [Eph. 5 : 27], holy and immaculate, and so most
chaste even as she is in the heavenly country. Nevertheless
by fornicating with the adulterant devil and with many of
his children she is partially corrupt by wrong-doing. How-
ever, she is never received as the bride to be embraced,
beatifically at the right hand and in the bed of the bride-
groom, until she has become a pure virgin, altogether with-
out wrinkle. For Christ is the bridegroom of virginity, who,
as he lives forever, can not allow the bride to desert him and
fornicate spiritually. Thus it is said of the multitude of the
heavenly denizens that they are virgins and follow the Lamb
wheresoever he goeth [Rev. 14 ε 4]. But in the very first
moment of the world Christ was predestinated to be the bride-
groom of the church, and by establishing the angels [in glory]
he gave a dowry to one part of the bride. And so also by es-
tablishing righteous Abel and other saints, up to the time of
the incarnation, the church remained continually in her es-
pousals. At the incarnation he made his second marriage by
creating to be a queen a part of the whole church, which by
a certain fitness is called the Christian church. For then
our leader and legislator familiarly addressed his bride, as
the apostle says, Heb. 1. By assuming human nature he put
on our armor and as a giant overcame the enemies of the
church and taught how a part of the church, as a jealous bride,
ought to follow him.

Therefore, the whole of Christian doctrine is involved in
that prayer oi the church in which we pray the bridegroom,
by his coming into the flesh, that he may teach us to despise
earthly things and love heavenly things—to despise, that is,
to subordinate, terrestrial things in our affections and to love
Christ the bridegroom above all things,
