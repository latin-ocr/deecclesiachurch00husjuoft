220 THE CHURCH

neutral is used because it does not dispose to virtue more
than to vice, or the contrary.

Further, it is to be noted that there is an immediate
distinction between human works, because whether they are
virtuous or vicious is manifest, for, if a man is vicious and
does something, then he acts viciously; and if he is virtu-
ous and does something, then he acts virtuously, for just
as vice, which is called crime or mortal sin, infects the acts
of the whole man, so virtue gives life to all the acts of a vir-
tuous man, in so far as that, living in grace, he is said to
be meritorious and pray even in sleeping or in doing any-
thing whatsoever, as the holy doctors say, especially St.
Augustine, Gregory, Jerome and others. And this state-
ment is founded in the words of Jesus Christ our Saviour:
“If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light‚''
that is, if thy purpose be good and in grace unto the doing
of good works, then “thy whole body,’' that is, the sum of
all thy works, “will be full of light‚'' because they are pure
in the sight of God. “But if thine eye be evil,'’ that is,
thy purpose be bad, tainted and incriminate with vice, “thy
whole body,’' that is, the sum of thy works, “will be full
of darkness,'’ that is, will be vicious. Hence, the doctor
of the Gentiles, the apostle Paul, teaches thus: “Do all to
the glory of God,'' II Cor. 10 : 31, and, “Let all your things
be done in love,'' I Cor. 16 : 14. Therefore‚ the whole mode
of living in love is virtuous, and the whole mode of a man's
living without love is vicious.

From this it is clear that, as no one may be neutral, so
far as virtue and vice go, since it must needs be that one is
in the grace of Almighty God or outside it, so no conduct
of any man may be neutral. In the case of virtuous com-
mands, therefore, the superior is to be obeyed, but of vicious
commands he is to be boldly withstood. These things hav-
ing been stated [Chapter XVII, on Obedience], every one of
Christ's faithful ought truly to be on his guard lest he be-
