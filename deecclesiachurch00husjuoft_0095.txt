GOOD AND BAD IN THE CHURCH 41

of the world the good fish will be gathered into vessels, but
the bad cast out, because every elect person is received into
everlasting habitations, and the reprobate, having lost the
light of the eternal realm, are cast into outer darkness. For
now the net of saith holds the good—that is, the elect—and
the evil—that is, the reprobate—mingled together, like the
fishes. This is the fourth resemblance. And the net which
she drew, namely, by the call of saith, represents the shore of
holy church.'' And St. Gregory adds: “And the fish of the
sea which were caught cannot be numbered. But we who are
bad when we are caught are thoroughly changed in the ele-
ment of goodness.” In this he finds a sign that the wicked
who are predestinate are permanently and thoroughly changed
into what is good. Therefore, the voice of St. Gregory is the
voice of the predestinate who, being smitten with badness, are
through baptism and penance called back by holy church to
goodness.

From these things is evident the exposition of the second
proof from the parable of the marriage supper, in which are
gathered by saith the good and the bad, who are mingled in
holy church. But the bad are not true sons, just as those are
not true friends, because they lack the marriage garment,
which is predestinating love. Hence the king of the wedding
will say to them, as he said to the one: “F riend, why did'st
thou come in hither not having a wedding-garment?'' At
this point Gregory says: “It is very remarkable, my dear
friends, that he at one and the same time calls this one friend
and condemns him, as if he might more aptly say: ‘F riend and
no-friend—friend by saith and no—friend by works.’'’ Thus
much Gregory [Migne, 76 : 1289].

The exposition of the third proof is clear because they
gather up from the kingdom of holy church all that offend,
that is, those who commit iniquity, namely, the sin of final im-
penitence [the parable of the tares, Matt. 13 ε 41]. Here the
reprobate are referred to.
