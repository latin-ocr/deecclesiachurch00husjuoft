128 THE CHURCH

three years because he wished ¹ to favor the Arians. At
the counsel of the same Constantius, the Roman clergy or-
dained Felix pope who, during the sessions of a synod con-
demned and cast out two Arian presbyters, Ursacius and
Valens, and when this became known, Liberius was recalled
from exile, and being wearied by his long exile and exhilarated
by the reoccupation of the papal chair, he yielded to heret-
ical depravity; and when Felix was cast down, Liberius
with violence held the church of Peter and Paul and St.
Lawrence so that the clergy and priests who favored Felix
were murdered in the church, and Felix was martyred, Li-
berius not preventing.

As for antichrist occupying the papal chair, it is evi-
dent that a pope living contrary to Christ, like any other
perverted person, is called by common consent antichrist.
In accordance with John 2 : 22, many are become anti-
christs. And the faithful will not dare to deny persistently
that it is possible ior the man of sin to sit in the holy place.
Of him the Saviour prophesied when he said: “When ye see
the abomination of desolation, which is spoken of by Daniel,

¹ Voluit, that is, Constantius wished. The original has noluit “he would
not,’' referring to Liberius’s refusal to consent to heresy. Cestrensis inter-
jects the statement, which Huss omits, that “Constantius recalled Liberius
from exile as one who treated the Arians more mildly.'' The implication is
that during his exile in Thrace Liberius yielded to heretical views, or perhaps
on his way back to Rome, where he remained very popular and whither he
was recalled by the emperor. The statement of the text represents the
view which prevailed during the Middle Ages. Felix’s martyrdom was as-
cribed to his being cast into a hole where he died after languishing for seven
months. The history of Liberius and Felix is a matter of historical uncertainty.
Dollinger, Fables of the M iddle Ages, Engl. translation, 183-209, pronounced
the mediaeval view an invention oi the sixth or seventh century, and rejected
the charge οἱ heresy made against Liberius as well as the story of F elix's mar-
tyrdom. Liberius was pope 352—366 with an interim of three years. Felix
died a natural death, 365. It is difficult to exempt Liberius altogether from the
taint of heresy in spite oi Sozomen's spirited denial of it. Athanasius implies
that he was a heretic and Jerome distinctly called him one. In a document,
whose genuineness is questioned, Hilary anathematized the unfortunate pon-
tiff. Felix‘s name was included in the Breviary from which it has been ex-
punged and his bust was given a place in the Siena cathedra! among other

popes.
