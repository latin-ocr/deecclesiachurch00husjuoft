236 THE CHURCH

Moses' seat, that they lay heavy burdens and grievous to
be borne on men's shoulders, but do not move them with
one of their own fingers. Even so, modern prelates and
penitentiaries impose many fastings‚ many prayers, and other
hard things upon the people, and they alone do not do the
least of them.

Hence, they more often say: “Let us eat and gamble and
the coarse may do our fasting.'' Therefore‚ when the Saviour
calls such hard commandments as they lay upon men un-
bearable burdens because they are weighty beyond Christ’s
counsels and commands, what wise man will say that infe-
riors are bound in such things to obey their prelate under
pain of mortal sin? Likewise to eat with unwashen hands
is a neutral work, neither absolutely good nor absolutely
evil, and Christ's disciples were not obligated by the com-
mand os those sitting in Moses’ seat to do it. Nor are we
now. The consequence has been stated, for the reasoning
is the same in the case of traditions of this kind, which are
not founded in the Lord’s law.

The second part is manifest from Matt. 15 : 2, when the
Pharisees and scribes said to Jesus, “Why do thy disciples
transgress the traditions of the elders? for they wash not
their hands when they eat bread,'' but he, rebuking them
for the transgression of God's commandments, showed that
his disciples did not sin in not keeping their command-
ments, and he said: “To eat with unwashen hands defileth
not the man.'’ What, therefore, is the reason now, that any
inferior in any act whatsoever that is neutral or intermediate
should be obligated to obey his prelate, if it happens that
the prelate is callous‚ who indiscreetly and overmuch bur-
dens an inferior with such neutral acts? Hence, ‘as said
above. Bernard well lays down the conditions of obedience‚
one of which is that a work commanded is judicious when
neither excess nor defect attaches to it.

Hence, no human commandment or decree is valid or to
