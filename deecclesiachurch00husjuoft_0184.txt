130 THE CHURCH

These things being noted, in order to remove ambiguity,
I assume that the doctors in their writing designate by the
Roman church that church of which the Saviour said to Peter:
“On this rock I will build my church'' (see Chapter VII).
The holy writers and the Decretals speak of it as the Roman
church, Dist. 21 :3 [Friedberg, 1 : 70], 24 z 1, capp, 9, 14 [Fried-
berg, 1 ε 969, 970]. And in the Clementines‚ de J urejur-
ando [Friedberg‚ 2 : 1147]‚l it is said: “The Romans, princes,
professors os the orthodox saith, venerate with warm faith
and pure devotion the holy Roman church, whose head is
Christ, our Saviour‚ and the Roman pontiff, the Saviour's
vicar.'' ² And in the Sextus it is said: “Our alma mater, the
church'’ [F riedberg, 2 z 1106], and in the Extravagante of Boni-
face VIII, “The holy Roman church'' And the same is true
of the other statements made in other places and alleged above.

In regard to these follies of the Unlearned—dndoctorum—I
find these points: (1) The pope is the head of the holy Ro-
man church. (2) The college of cardinals is the body of the
holy Roman church. (3) The pope is manifestly and truly

was more influential than anything else in building up the arrogant claims of the
papacy. Dante denied the right of Constantine to grant secular power to the
pope, but did not call in question the authenticity of Constantine's gift. He
expressed himself in the lines:

Ah, Constantine, of how much ill was cause
Not thy conversion, but those rich domains
Which the first wealthy pope received of thee.

The fraud was not shown up till the middle of the fifteenth century by Lauren-
tius Valla‚ and a prosound impression was made upon Luther in 1520 when he
was insormed of the fraudulent character of the document by von Hutten. Of
course, Constantine was baptized by Eusebius of Nicomedia, and not till the
very last year of his life and never had the leprosy. Huss fully believed the story
and often refers to the donation as the beginning of papal wealth‚ pomp, and
corruption. The text in Mirbt, pp. 81-87. Also Boehmer’s art. in Herzog,
XI, 1-7.

¹ The first of these decretals is by Gelasius, 49 5, and states that the “holy
Roman catholic and apostolic church is placed at the head of the other churches
not by virtue of the action of synods but by the appointment oi Christ.” The
second is by Lucius, the third by Jerome writing to Pope Damasus.

2 Clement V. 1314. the first os the Avignon popes. He declares that the “Ro-
man church transferred the empire from the Greeks to the Germans.”
