THE CHURCH FoUNDED ON CHRIST 77

himself the stone and the Rock of foundation, for the Lord
says: “Behold I will lay for a foundation in Zion a corner-
stone tried and precious, a stone of sure foundation,'’ Isaiah
28 : 16. And also in the Psalms 118 : 22. “The stone which
the builders rejected has been made the head of the corner.'' ¹
Therefore, Christ himself is the foundation of the apostles
and the whole church‚ and in him it is fitly framed to-
gether.

For this reason the apostle says: “So then ye are no more
strangers and sojourners‚ but ye are fellow citizens with the
saints and of the household of God, being built upon the
foundation of the apostles and prophets‚ Jesus Christ him-
self being the chief comer-stone, in whom each several build-
ing fitly framed together groweth into a holy temple unto
the Lord‚’' Eph. 2 ε 19—21. Here St. Remigius says [Migne's
ed.‚ 117 ι 711]: “The foundation of the apostles and prophets
and of all the faithful is Christ because they are established
and grounded in faith in him, just as he himself said, ‘On
this Rock' that is, ‘on myself‚ I will build my church,'
which consists of angels and righteous men. For every one
that hath faith in Christ is founded upon him, Christ Jesus
himself being the chief comer-stone. How, then, is Christ
the foundation and the chief stone? For this reason, that
faith begins with him and is perfected and completed in him
and by him so that all the elect are grounded in him.'' Thus
Remigius Haymo.2

From these things it is plain that Christ alone is the
chief foundation of the church‚ and in this sense the apostle
thought of that foundation, because he did not dare to speak
of anything except what was built upon that foundation.
Hence he says: “1 will not dare to speak of any thing save
those which Christ wrought through me by the obedience
