 

OBEDIENCE TO PRELATES 261

that no one of the holy bishops dared to bring a judgment
against Pope Marcellinus, but they said: “By thine own
mouth judge thy case. Thou shalt not subject thyself to
our decision. '' That is to say, that this saying of the bishops
is not sufficient to nullify God’s law according to which
in the case of Paul he reproved Peter the pope. Secondly,
it means that it would be most superfluous for them to re-
prove him in such a case, who observed from his contri-
tion that he was fully reproved of the Lord. Thirdly, it
means that he was sufficiently reproved by thern when they
said, “by thine own mouth judge thy case, thou shalt not be
subject to our decision.'' And still again, it means, Be not
heard at our tribunal but gather up thy case in thy own
bosom and once more thou wilt be declared righteous of thy-
self, they say, or be condemned out of thine own mouth.
Certainly that was a great act of reproving, because those
who reproved cast the duty of reproving back on the pope
himself. Hence Marcellinus, when he heard these things, de-
clared the sentence of deposition against himself.l

Thus it is clear that a subject following the rule of pru—
dence and of love may correct an erring superior and lead him
back to the way of truth. For, if a superior should wander
away and come into a cave of thieves or into the danger of
death, it would be proper for the subject to draw him back
and to preserve him from danger. Therefore, this is the more
allowable when a superior by a devious path of living runs
into the cave of demons and into the peril of the worst death
of sins. If, therefore, in the first case, the superior would

¹Marce11inus, whom Jerome [Migne, 27 z 1111] puts among the popes,
probably of the time of Diocletian, is reported to have fallen away in time
of persecution and sacrificed to the gods. He acknowledged his mistake in
the presence of a synod of bishops who refused to sit in judgment on him on
the ground that prima sedes a nemine judicatur—the primal see is judged
by no one. This was the theory asserted by the mediaeval popae. They were
subject to no tribunal but God. Higden, 5 t 104-108, reported the tradition
that Marcellinus deposed himself and anathematized any one that should bury
his body.
