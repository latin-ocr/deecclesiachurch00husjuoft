288 THE CHURCH

ilarly to present the sacrament of the eucharist to the devout
people and to baptize are works of mercy. What, therefore,
is the reason for withdrawing these things from the people
of God without any demerit on their part?

Hence St. Augustine writes to Bishop Maximus‚1 24: 3
[Friedberg, 1 :987 sqq.]: “If thou hast a judgment about
this matter, based on sure reasoning or Scripture testimonies,
wilt thou deign to teach us how a son may be righteously
anathematized for the sins of his father, or a wife for the sin of
her husband, or a servant for the sin of his master, or how any
one in the household, yea a child not yet born—if born at
the time, when the household is held under the band of anath-
ema—why it should not be healed by the laver of regen-
eration if it were in danger of death? For this was bodily
punishment of which we read that some despisers of God
with all their households‚ which had been partakers of the
same impiety‚ perished among the saints.2 Then forsooth,
that the living might be struck with sear, the mortal bodies
which were destined sometime to die were destroyed. But
the spiritual punishment of which it is written, ‘Whatso-
ever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven‚’
binds souls, and of them it is said, As the soul of the father is
mine, so is the soul of the son mine. ‘The soul that sinneth
it shall die' [Ezek. 18 : 201. Ye perhaps have heard of some
priests of great name who anathematized some sinner includ-
ing his household, but if perchance they were ever asked about
it, it would be found that they did not give me a fitting
reason [for the act]. But, if any one should ask me whether
it was done rightly I do not find anything to reply to them.
I have never dared to do this thing for any deeds done against
the church, without having admonished most solemnly. But,
if God has revealed to thee that this was done righteously,

¹The Decretum and also Nic. Fathers, 1 z 589 sq„ give it as a letter to
Auxssius, probably bishop of Murco.

2Ρενίἱςςε inter sanctos. The Decretum has pariter interfectos: “were like-
wise put to death.’'
