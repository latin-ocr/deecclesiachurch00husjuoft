OBEDIENCE TO PRELATES 253

on his part3 and they shall profane the sanctuary and they
shall set up the abomination that maketh for desolation, and
such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert
by flatteries, but the people that know their God shall be
strong and do exploits‚'’ Daniel 11 :31-32. Antichrist’s
“arms which stand and profane God's sanctuary’' are wicked
prelates who are an abomination on account of their villainies,
and they are the “desolation'' by refusing to imitate Christ.
Of this abomination Christ says, “when ye see the abomina-
tion of desolation standing in the holy place which was spoken
of by Daniel the prophet‚'' Matt. 24: 15, and, “standing
where he ought not,” Mark 13 ε 14. And when the prophet
adds, “and such as do wickedly against the covenant,'' for
they say they keep Christ's covenant, but will not keep it,
because they obscure and gloss it for their own exaltation
and to excuse their sin, “but the people that know their
God‚” that is, know by the gift of God's grace, will obtain
Christ by imitation of him and will do the commandments
of the covenant of the Lord Jesus Christ. But because to
those that teach these things persecution comes unto death,
therefore Daniel further says: “And they that are wise
among the people shall instruct many and shall fall by the
sword and in the flames and in the captivity and by the
fall of days. And when these shall fall, they shall be lifted
up by the help of the little ones and many shall J'oin them-
selves unto them with flatteries,'’ Dan. 11 : 33—34.

The experience of the facts enables us to understand this
text, for simple laymen and priests, taught by God’s grace,
teach very many by the example of a good life and, gainsay-
ing publicly antichrist's lying words, perish with the sword.
This is seen in the cases of the laymen, John, Martin, and
Stafcon,¹ who resisted antichrist's lying disciples, and per-
