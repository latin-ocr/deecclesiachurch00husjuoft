2 THE CHURCH

gether under one rule, as Aristotle teaches‚ Polit. 2 t 7¹, when
he says: “All have part in the church.’' In view of this
meaning, therefore, the congregation of all men is called the
church—ecclesia. This appears in Matt. 25 : 31—33, which
says: “When the Son of Man shall come in his glory and all
his angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his
glory and before him shall be congregated all nations.'' What
a great congregation of all men under the rule of Christ the
king that will be! Because, however, the whole of that con-
gregation is not the holy church it is added, “and he will sepa-
rate them, the one from the other, as a shepherd separates the
sheep from the goats.”

From this it is evident that there is one church—ecclesia
—of the sheep and another of the goats, one church of the
righteous and another of the reprobate—praesciti.2 Likewise
the church of the righteous is on the one hand catholic, that
is, universal, which is not a part of anything else. Of this I
am now treating. On the other hand, it is particular, a part
with other parts, as the Saviour said, Matt. 18 : 20: “Where
two or three are congregated together in my name, there am
I in the midst of them.'’ From this it follows that two right-
eous persons congregated together in Christ's name constitute,
with Christ as the head, a particular holy church, and like-
wise three or four and so on to the whole number of the pre-
destinate without admixture. In this sense the term church
is oi ten used in Scripture, as when the apostle says, Ι Cor. 1 ε 1:
“To the church which is in Corinth, to the sanctified in Jesus

² The foreknown, that is, those oi whom God knows beforehand that they
are not in a state of permanent grace. Their condition is not the result of an
active decree, though it is a subiect of God's previous knowledge. The fore-
known are in grace according to present righteousness and desire through rnerit
at once eternal bliss and at the same time their damnation. This apparent
contradiction Huss explains to lie in this, that they are not willing to use the
means to the attainment of eternal bliss, just as a person may wish a coat and
yet not possess it. Super IV. Sent„ 188.
