202 THE CHURCH

All such are thieves and robbers, as said the Shepherd truly,
“As many as came before me are thieves and robbers‚'’ for
all such, the aforesaid, came to the sheepfold apart from
Christ, ascended to the cathedra by some other way, sought
the things that are their own and so they are to be called
hirelings, not shepherds. Therefore, the Saviour, showing
who is an hireling and not a shepherd, said: “An hireling,
and he who is not the shepherd and whose own the sheep
are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep,
and fleeth away, and the wolf snatcheth and scattereth the

things, whoever he may be, he is an hireling; let him not
count himself among the children. For of such the Lord
says: ‘Verily I say unto you, they have received their re-
ward.’ '' Thus far Augustine. But because men of this kind
sit in the cathedra, Augustine, after interposing some things,
says at the same place: “But take note how the hirelings
are necessary. Many, forsooth, in the church who pursue
after worldly comforts nevertheless preach Christ and through
them Christ's voice is heard, and the sheep follow not the
