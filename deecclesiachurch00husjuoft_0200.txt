146 THE CHURCH

in waging warfare, in patience and toil, and out of the great
bond of love, then is he holy. But far be it that he is most
holy, because then he would be God almighty and conse-
quently not the vicar of Jesus Christ. For Christ did not
want the woman to kiss his feet after the resurrection—im-
mortal and undoubtedly blessed—so that he keep from blas-
phemous presumption the miserable persons who, for the
time, falsely assume that they are Christ’s vicars. But the
feet of Christ and those ascending with Christ are blessed
and not the food of worms, a putrid member and a fetid sweat
of mundane fluids. By these things we should be persuaded
in regard to the fourth point—namely‚ that the cardinals
are the manifest and true successors of the apostles, that it
does not contain the truth. For by the fruits which it bears,
is the tree known.
