house of God‚ as Augustine in his Exposition os tlte Creed says,¹
but they should believe that the catholic church is the bride
of the Lord Jesus Christ—bride, I say, chaste, incorrupt, and

at Paris. He wrote commentaries on the Psalms, Genesis, etc.‚ and 12 Hom-
ilies on Matthew‚ all found in Migne, 131. He supported Paschasius's view
of the change of the eucharistie elements.

and a forerunner of the sentences os Peter the Lomhard and the systems of
the summists of the Middle Ages Isidore, archbishop of Seville (d. 636),

especially by his encyclopedic works, the Etymologiae and the de natura rerum.
