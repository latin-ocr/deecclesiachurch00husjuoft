GOOD AND BAD IN THE CHURCH 51

assembly of the reprobate. It is by a sheer error that men
living on the earth speak in this way of the true holy mother
church, and so many according to common fame are called
heads or members of the church, although according to God’s
foreknowledge they are members of the devil, who for a time
believe and afterwards fall away or are now and always were
unbelievers‚ and of this sort, as already said above and to
follow Augustine‚ were those disciples of Christ who went
back and no longer walked with him. Similarly, it was with
Iscariot who was falsely reputed to be a disciple of Christ,
about whom Augustine‚ in his Commentary on John [Nic.
Fathers, 7 : 2 53], speaks when he shows how the sheep
heard Christ's voice. “But what,'' he says, “are we to think?
Those who heard—were they the sheep? Did not Judas
hear and he was a wolf? He followed but was clothed in
sheep's clothing and plotted against the Shepherd.'' In
this way, therefore, many are reputed according to present
righteousness to be of the church, but they are not really so
by virtue of predestination unto glory. And who these are
Augustino teaches in his Commentary on John, when he says:
“The Lord knows who are his. He knows who will hold out
till the conferring of the crown‚ who will hold out unto the
flames. He knows in his threshjng-floor the wheat, he knows
the chaff, he knows the good seed, he knows the tares. But
to the rest it is unknown who are doves and who are ravens.’'
