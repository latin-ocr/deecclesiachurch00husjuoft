SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT 293

method? Of the apostolic church? What apostle observed
this method or what saint after the apostles? Never was
it the method of Christ, that head of the holy church, in
whose method all truth useful for the church is contained.

But I ask where is this saying found: “Every place,
city, walled town, villa, or castle, privileged or not privileged‚
to which the same John Huss may have gone, and how long
soever he may remain and how long soever he may tarry‚ and
for three natural days after his departure from such places,
we, by these writings‚ do put them under such a great ec-
clesiastica] interdict and wish that divine ministries be stopped
in them ’'?

Perhaps that method is founded on these words: “Men
ought always to pray and not to faint,'’ Luke 18 : 2, or on
these: “Praise God all ye peoples‚'’ and these: “In every
place praise ye the Lord.'' And what will the authors of the
method say, if it should happen that John Huss came to
the holy city, Jerusalem, in which cherubim and seraphim
cease not to cry daily with one voice, saying: “Holy, holy,
holy, Lord God of Sabaoth''? Will they then stop these
ministries there in obedience to the fulmination, just as if
Christ, the righteous advocate, would not intercede to God
the Father for his faithful members or that the angelic choir
would not sing: “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth’'?
Will that voice stop of which John says: “1 heard a voice
of many angels round about the throne and the living crea-
tures and the elders, and the number of thern was thousands
of thousands saying with a great voice, ‘Worthy is hel that
hath been slain to receive the power, and the riches, and
wisdom‚ and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing'; and
every created thing which was in the heavens and which is
on the earth, under the earth, and in the sea and all things
that are in them,'' Rev. 5 z 11-13? And let not the doctors
say that this is not pertinent, for all rational creatures‚ ac-
