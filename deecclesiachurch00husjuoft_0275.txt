ECCLESIASTICAL SUPERIORS 2 2 1

lieve that if the Roman pontiff or a prelate commands any-
thing whatsoever‚ it is to be done as though it were a man-
date of God, and that the prelate cannot err, even as Jesus
Christ cannot.

Secondly, let him hold in regard to the commands in
God’s laW, how some are commanded us in a mixed way
and others distinctly. In a mixed way the commands are
commanded which we ought to do every day and meritori-
ously, after the manner of which Augustine says, that all
truth is contained in the Scriptures. But a work that is
commanded, for which there is no reason or utility to the
church of Christ, is not contained explicitly or implicitly in
the Scriptures. And if such be commanded by pope or
other prelate, the inferior is not bound to perform it, lest,
in so doing, he offend against the liberty of the Lord's law.
For we ought to receive as of saith that God commands us
to do nothing except what is meritorious for us and reason-
able, and consequently profitable to salvation.

The conclusion should be this: Subjects are bound to
obey willingly and cheerfully virtuous, yea, and hard su-
periors, when they command us to do the mandates of the
Lord Jesus Christ. This conclusion is evident, for Christ
says, “The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. All
things, therefore, whatsoever they bid you, these do,” Matt.
23 : 1, that is, all my commandments. Here Augustine,
Com. on John, 20 [Nic. Fatlzers, 7 : 443]‚ says: “In sitting in
Moses' seat, they teach God’s law. Therefore God teaches
through thern. But, if they wish to teach their own things,
do not hear them, do not do them.’' And on this subject
Christ also said, “He that heareth you, heareth me, and he
that despiseth you,'' etc.‚ Luke 10 : 16, consequently, also,
God the Father; because such persons are not obeyed as
men, but as ministers of God, who is to be obeyed above all.

Therefore, no one should obey man in anything, even
the least thing, that opposes itself to the divine commands,
