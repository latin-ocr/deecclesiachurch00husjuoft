ALL CHRISTIANS ARE NOT MEMBERS 23

of grace—making ready—in the present time, and of glory
in the future. But the position is taken, de Penilentia, Dist.
4 [Friedberg, 1 : 1234]‚ Hinc propheta, that predestination is
twofold: First‚ the one predestination by which a person is
foreordained here to righteousness and the acceptance of the
remission of sins, but not for the obtaining os the life of glory.l
To this predestination the second definition, as given above,
does not apply. The other predestination is that whereby
a person is predestinated to obtain eternal life in the future.
The first kind of predestination follows this, and not vice
versa. For, if any one is predestinated to eternal life, it·
necessarily follows that he is predestinated unto righteousness,'
and, if he follows life eternal, he has also followed righteous-
ness. But the converse is not true. For, many are made
partakers of present righteousness but, from want of per-
severance, are not partakers of life eternal. Hence it is said,
de Penitentia, 4, Hoc ergo: “Many seem to be predestinate
by the merit of present righteousness and not by the pre-
destination of eternal glory.'' And Gratian grounds this
position in the words of the apostle, Eph. 1 : 3—7: “Blessed be
the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed
us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in
Christ: even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of
the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before
Him in love: who predestinated us unto the adoption of sons
through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His
will to the praise of the glory of His grace, which is freely
bestowed on us in His beloved Son, in whom we have our re-
demption through His blood unto² the remission of sins.''
Further, it is evident that men may be of holy mother
church in two ways—either by predestination to life eternal,
the way all who are finally holy are of holy mother church,

1 ε 1229 sqq.]; Huss doae not quote Augustine‚ but Gratian's comment.
