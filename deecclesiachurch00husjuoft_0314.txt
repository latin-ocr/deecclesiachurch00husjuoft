260 THE CHURCH

or neutral or even in an act good generically‚ showing the
reason why it is not expedient in such a case to obey. This
has frequently happened to me, when Ι have commanded;
and being taught better and even taking gratefully infor-
mation, I have obeyed the student. And the same reason-
ing holds in respect to a prelate, for in our times prelates
often talk wildly in their commands because of ignorance,
and are to be reasoned with in love, by their subjects, for the
well-being of the church.

But it is objected to this that an equal has no rule over
an equal. Since, therefore, the pope excels every other pil-
grim and every superior his subject, it seems that it is not
the business of any pilgrim to correct the pope or any sub-
ject his prelate. This means that, if the antecedent be
denied, since necessarily God the F ather has no rule over
the Holy Spirit, and yet they are equal persons, the con-
sequence does not follow, namely‚ that of necessity God the
Father has rule over the Son, according to the humanity
he assumed and yet necessarily they are absolutely equal.
Therefore‚ if no equal has rule over an equal‚ the catholic
saith is gainsaid. And again: as is the rule of a vicar,
so also oi the same kind is all human rule, as the apos-
tle says: “Charge them that are rich in this present world
that they be not high-minded‚'' I Tim. 6. But such rule
is either independent, derived from itseH, or it is originally
authorized over some creature, and so it is clear how bare
this mode of reasoning is both as to its substance and form,
for he understands by this principle that an equal has no
authoritative rule over his equal, on the ground by which
he is equal to one who rules in such a way. But what
stands in the way of one who excels in virtue telling to one
inferior in his living his fault, howbeit the latter be the su-
perior in rank?

Besides, the objection is raised from the canon law,
Dist. 21, Nunc autem [F riedberg‚ 1 : 71], where it is declared
