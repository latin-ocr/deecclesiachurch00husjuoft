172 THE CHURCH

they follow the pontiffs, scribes and Pharisees who, when
Christ refused to obey them in all things, said: “ It is not law-
ful for us to put any man to death,'’ and then delivered him

church a place, the basilica of St. Peter, or the apostolical
dignity, for in these two senses “the place'' in their state-
ment may be understood, for there the Lord located the
chief government—principatus-—of the whole church because
