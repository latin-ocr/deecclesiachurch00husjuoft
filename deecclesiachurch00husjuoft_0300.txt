246 THE CHURCH

to dare to submit to the judgment of such a consistory—
namely, to place oneself in the bosom of enemies and to
offer oneself voluntarily to a death from violent injury and
not by formal justice? That, indeed, is to be feared from
the side of the law, that is to be evaded as a matter of morals;
that human sense and reason flee from; that nature abhors.
Therefore, he would be a fool who would dream of such a
citation binding the one cited.’' Nor ought the means of
defenee to be taken away which come from the law of nature,
for the emperor himself has no right to withdraw those things
which are provided by the law of nature.

Likewise, Pope Nicolas wrote to the emperor Michael‚
3 : 5 [Friedberg‚ 1 : 518]: “That suspects and enemies ought
not to be judges, reason itself dictates, and it is proved by
many examples. For what could any one give more ac-
ceptable and to be desired to an enemy than to commit a
person to him to be assailed‚ who might greatly wish to
hurt him?'' This thing also the Constantinopolitan synod,
Canon 6 [381 A. D.], is known to prohibit, and in the very
same chapter [Friedberg‚ 1:518] Pope Gelasius¹ a most
brave assailer of heretics, says: “I ask for the tribunal to
which they lay claim. Where can they carry their cases?
Before those who are enemies and at the same time wit-
nesses and judges? But to such a tribunal no human busi-
ness should be committed. And if to a tribunal, where ene-
mies are the judges, no human business should be carried,
how much less ought cases of divine import, that is, ecclesi-
astical cases be carried! He that is wise‚ let him understand.
And in truth‚ for this reason, the good emperor Justinian
is known to have promulgated in his laws the same, when
he said: ‘He who thinks a judge partial may, before the
trial begins, accuse him that the case may revert to another.
For it is just as natural to shun the assaults of judges as to
wish to fiee from the sentence of enemies.' Thus St. John
