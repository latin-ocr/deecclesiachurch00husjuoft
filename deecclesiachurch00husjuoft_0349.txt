 

SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT 295

Because not upon the pope but upon the head, Christ, does
her life depend. And blessed be God that, when a pope is
insane or become a heretic, the church militant remains the
faithful spouse of the Lord Jesus Christl¹ Blessed also be
the Lord, the one living head of the church‚ who preserves
her so effectually in unity that, even now, while there are
three so-called papal heads, she remains the one spouse of
the Lord Jesus Christ!

For now Balthazar, called John XXIII, is in Rome; and
Angelo Correr, called Gregory XII, is in Rimini; and Peter
de Luna, called Benedict, is in Aragon. Why does not one
of them, called most holy father, out of the fulness of power
constrain the others with their adherents to submit to his
jurisdiction? By authority of which one does the Roman
curia speak; which one has fulness of power over every man
on earth? Therefore, the foundation is feeble enough as a
foundation and proof, to wit, that anything should be held
to be inviolable which is announced by the Roman curia.
For the rule is laid down, de Constitutionibus, lib. 6, [Fried-
berg, 2 :937], that, when two persons having letters from
the pope in regal-d to the same provision given on the same
day, he to whom the pope offered the canonical office has
the preference, to whom he did not give it without the knowl-
edge of the executor2 who first besought it. But if they
are equally in grace, so far as the form of the papal brief
goes, <he who first presents it [in the diocese concerned] will
have the stronger claim over the prebend. And, thirdly, if
they were equal in these three things then the canons, to
whom the collation pertains‚ or the greater part of them, are
bound to proceed to an election, the one left out being de-

¹ In arguing for the superiority of a general council over the pope, Gerson
took the ground that a pope may be deposed who is insane or heretical. The
translator must confess that in this translation he has been inconsistent in
treating church now as neuter, now as feminine.

²The executor, usually called procurator, is the legal representative who
appears before the ecclesiastical superior or puts into execution a papal or
episcopal mandate. See Hergenrother‚ K .-reclzt‚ 4285 Friedberg‚ K.—recht‚ pp.
