204 THE CHURCH

say and do not, they teach in words and break in their lives.' ''
similarly, it is said, Psalm 119 : 2: “ Blessed are they that keep
his testimonies‚ that seek him with a whole heart.'’

From what has just been said it is clear that the cath-
edra of Moses or the apostolic seat is the authority to teach
God's laW, that is, the family of holy popes or of bishops
succeeding the apostles, which family, as it chiefly thinks of
God's honor, so it chiefly takes care for it and most prof-
itably looks out for the holy church and most helpfully for
both superior and subject—not by preferring the unworthy,
not in putting aside the more fit, not in confirming without
examination an ecclesiastical office to any one for gain or blood
relationship or private personal tie.

And, further, it is clear, as concerning the apostolic com-
mands, as said the lord of Lincoln¹ in the following reply to
the letters of the Roman pontiff about preferring a certain
relative to a stall in Lincoln church: “The apostolic corn-
mands I fully obey with filia] affection, devotedly and rev-
erently. Indeed, 1 oppose and resist those who oppose
themselves to the apostolic commands, myself zealous for
the paternal honor. To do both I consider myself held by
reason of my sonship and out of regard to the divine com-

¹ Robert Grosseteste‚ the famous bishop of Lincoln, 123 5-1 2 53, was one of
the chief English ecclesiastics of the Middle Ages. He was a scholar and pa-
tron of learning as well as a vigorous and independent episcopal administrator.
The letters, quoted here and further on, are found in Luard's ed.‚ Rolls Series,
1864, pp. 435, 43 7. Grosseteste made bold protest against Innocent IV's
appointment of his nephew, F red. of Lavagna to a stall at Lincoln. It was
one of the boldest protests made against the custom of appointing Italians to
rich English livings. Matthew Paris referred to the papal exactions upon
England as “bloodsucking extortion.‘’ Shakespeare expraesed a wide-spread
feeling, King John, 3 ε 1:

“That no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toil in our dominions.''

Although Grosseteste on more than one occasion resisted the pope, he did
not at one time deny the pope's right to “dispose freely of all ecclesiastica!
benefices,’' as he wrote, 1238 to the papal legate Otho, Luard’s ed.‚ p. 145.
But in the letter from which Huss quotes, he said: “ I disobey, I resist, I rebel.’'
Huss knew of Grosseteste through Wyclif's quotations, but, as is also probable,
at first hand, as Grosseteste's MSS. are in the Prague library.
