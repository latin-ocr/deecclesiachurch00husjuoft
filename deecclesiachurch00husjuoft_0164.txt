110 THE CHURCH

of the keys is and what is catholic belief on the subject,
namely, that every priest of Christ ordained according to

μ ’χ the rite has the sufficient power to confer the sacraments ap-

pertaining to him and consequently to absolve a person truly
contrite from sin, howbeit power of this kind, so far as the
exercise of it goes, is for good reasons bound in the case of
many persons, as appears near the beginning of this chapter.
But how this power belonged to the apostles equally is stated
in the Decretum, Dist. 21, in novo [Friedberg‚ 1 : 69], where
it is said:¹ “The other apostles with him, that is, Peter, by
reason of equal fellowship received honor and power. . . .
When these died, the bishops arose in their place.'' And
here the Gloss, Argumentum, says that the bishops are all
equal in apostolic power, so far as the order and ground of
consecration go. St. Cyprian, 24 z 1, cap. Loquitur [Fried-
berg, 1 : 971], says: “He gave to all the apostles after his
resurrection equal power.’'

Hence it would be foolish to believe that the apostles re-
ceived from Christ no spiritual gifts except what were de-
rived by them immediately and purely—Simpliciter-——from
Peter, for Christ said to all: “Whatsoever ye shall loose on
earth,’' Matt. 18: 183 also, “Receive ye the Holy spirit:
whosesoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them‚’' John
20 : 23; and again, “This do ye in remembrance of me,''
Luke 22 : 19; and still again, “All power is given unto me
in heaven and on earth. Go ye therefore and teach all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the
Son, and the Holy Spirit‚ teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever Ι have commanded² you; and lo, I am with you
all the days, even unto the consummation of the ages,'’
Matt. 28 : 19, 20.
