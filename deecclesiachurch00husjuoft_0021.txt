IN TRODUCTION xvii

Huss went still further, in declaring that popes may be
praesciti, reprobates, though legitimately elected to their of-
fice. Without definitely assigning by name this or that pon-
tiff to hell, as did Dante, yet Huss declared that popes there
have been who had conferred ample indulgences by word—
verbaliter—and are damned. Christ chose a thies as an
Apostle: so may the cardinals choose an antichrist as Roman
pontiff. The only standard by which it can be judged
whether a pope is a vicar of Christ or antichrist is by his
conformity to the law of Christ in daily life and ministries.l

The outward display assumed by popes, the kissing of
their feet, the name most holy—sanctissimus—by which they
allowed themselves to be addressed, Huss stigmatized, as
Luther did a hundred years later, as incompatible with—their
holy office.²

The origin of all this false pomp Huss found, as Wyclis did
before him, in the donation of Constantine, the fictitious gift
passed off upon credulous Europe by the pseudo-Isidorian
Decretals in the ninth century and to which appeal con-
tinued to be made down to Alexander VI in his bull dis-
tributing America between Spain and Portugal “forever,''
and later. As a compensation for being healed of leprosy
by Sylvester‚ Constantine bequeathed to that pontiff and
his successors civil rule over Rome and all the regions of the
West and conferred upon them the crown and the other
insignia of temporal lordship and glory. This imperial gift,
Wyclif and Huss contended‚ was the beginning of the de-
cline of the church from its pristine purity, and modern—
moderni—popes and cardinals who protruded their feet to
be kissed and gloried in the address “most holy'' did not
possess a scintilla of sanctity and utterly lacked the power

the divine titles assumed by Roman emperors such as “Lord God'' by Domi-
tian and our most holy lom-sacratissimus dominus noster—by Diocletian.
