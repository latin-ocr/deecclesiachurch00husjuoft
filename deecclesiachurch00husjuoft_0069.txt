THE ONE UNIVERSAL CHURCH 15

Augustine draws forth in expounding John 17:21, “that
they all may be one,'' and in his letter to Dardanus,¹ where
he expounds the text “it is expedient that one man die for
the people'’ [John 18: 14]. ‘⁵' Caiaphas,'' Augustine says:
“prophesied that God would gather together in one his chil-
dren'’ [John 11 : 52], that is, not in one material locality;
“ but he has gathered them together into one spirit and one
body, whose only head is Christ.'' To this unity the apostle
refers, Eph. 4: 3: “endeavoring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, one Spirit,
one Lord, one saith, one baptism, one God and Father of all.''
Nor is it to be doubted that without this union, as indicated
before, is there any salvation.

ffiwhoni, prgobably, Jerome also addressed a letter. For Augustine's letter,
