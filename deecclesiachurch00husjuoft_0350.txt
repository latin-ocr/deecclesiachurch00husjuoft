296 THE CHURCH

prived of the fruit of grace—unless from the tenor of the
papal letters it expressly appear that the pope wished to
provide for both of thern. But this three-membered method
of the curia seems to be a principle most contrary to Christ,
because, if it be laid down, as for the most part happens, that
the one placed in the canonical office, either by reason of the
time of the presentation or the bestowment of grace or,
thirdly, the election of the chapter is, in respect to God, some-
what less worthy than the one left out, then by this greatest
thing called method‚ a sentence ought to be pronounced
contrary to Christ. From this it follows that that greatest
thing called method is contrary to the conscience, and conse-
quently contrary to Christ. What sort of a proof‚ there-
fore, is this: “The method customary with the Roman curia
and observed by it grants a thing or affirms a thing; there-
fore, that thing is to be received as consonant with Christ's
law and as catholic''?

But this rustic mode of reasoning which the doctors lay
down, that “before the fathers of our fathers'’ such and such
a thing was believed and observed, would lead to the con-
clusion that the doctors themselves believe and observe false
customs of the Gentiles and Jews, yea, that they ought to
worship Baal, as the Bohemians worshipped him when they
were Gentiles. They have for their case the words of Ezek.
20 : 18: “Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither
observe their ordinances.'' How shameless, therefore, is this
argument of the doctors, “before the fathers of our fathers''
such or such a thing was believed, observed or held, therefore,
it ought to be believed, observed or held by us. For such in-
sipid arguments are made by unsanctified—insulsi, unsalted—
men, to excuse excuses for sins. Of their number is not he
who said: “We have sinned, O Lord, with our fathers; we have
committed iniquity; we have done wickedly. Our fathers
understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not
the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses,'’ Psalm 106 : 6, 7.
