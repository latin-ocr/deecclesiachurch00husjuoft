yond the limits of its own station. That is sufficient obe-
dience by which any one obeys in those things to which he
is expressly obligated, and examples of this there are in
holy Scripture. For children are bound to obey their par-
ents, according to the apostle where he says: “Children,
obey your parents in all things‚'' Col. 3 z 20. This is to be
understood only to apply to those things which concern the
outer course of life and household care, as Thomas says.
Similarly‚ servants are bound to obey their masters: “Obey
your masters according to the flesh in all things‚'’ Col. 3 ε 22,
and, “Servants, be in subjection to your masters in all sear,
not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward,’'
I Peter 2 : 18. These texts are to be understood only of
those things which apply to servile acts lawful to be per-
formed, as Thomas also says. Wives are held to obey their
husbands according to the words of the apostle, as above,
and also of Peter [Ι Peter 3 : 1]: “Wives, be in subjection
to your husbands in the Lord.'’ This is to be understood
only of those things which pertain to externa] marital con-
duct so far as such conduct is lawful.

Similarly‚ all Christians are bound to obey the secular
power, each in his own rank, as the apostle says, Titus
3 : 1: “Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers and
powers,” and, Romans 13 ε 1, “Let every soul be subject
unto the higher powers.'' Here the apostle proves that
every man is in duty bound to obey his superiors‚ both in
secular and spiritual affairs, because God's servants are or-
dained‚ the good to be guided, purged and to praise; but
the evil to be corrected, punished and to wrath, because
there is no power but of God, and he that resisteth the power
resisteth the ordinance os: God. With this Thomas agrees,
2 ε 14, art. 6 [Migne's ed., 3 ε 798]. And all this subjection
or obedience is understood among those ranks over which
the superiors have lawful authority, and in those cases when
they command righteous commands and not otherwise. The
