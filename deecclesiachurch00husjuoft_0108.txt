54 THE CHURCH

law of the final form, when the light parts will hasten upward
with their head, who is a consuming fire, to their appropriate
mansions among the saints, but the parts terrestrial, weighted,
as of lead, will go down to hell, even as John said, 21 ε 13:
“In a moment they went down into hell'' [sheol].

But the objection is drawn from St. Thomas [Summa,
III, q. 8 : 3-7, Migne], 3 ε 100 sqq„ when he says: “Christ is
the head of all men, both the faithful who are united unto
himself in deed through grace, and also the unbelieving who
are his members only potentially’⁷—in potentia. And later
on, he makes a division according to the predestinate and rep-
robate who, passing away from this world, cease wholly to be
members of Christ. This he thus explains: As for this state-
ment οἱ St. Thomas, it seems to me he speaks ambiguously‚
saying truly that in virtue of his deity, Christ is the outward
head oi the whole human race which, taken as an aggregate,
may be termed one natural body on which Christ confers
benefits as he does on the whole world. In virtue of his
humanity a secondary perfection was won by the merit of
Christ’s passion for the whole world, and so in virtue of his
humanity he does good to the whole human race—-when he
punishes all the damned, whether they are damned (1) be-
cause of unbelief, like those who did not believe in the Lord
Jesus Christ, or (2) because of despair which they ought to
have put aside, aspiring to heavenly things, or (3) because of a
rash and foolish judgment, which they ought to have put
aside, and finally accepted the Lord Jesus Christ in love.

Thus it appears how Christ is head of all men and how he
is also head of the predestinate; and how it is not contra-
dictory to speak of the body of the devil (which is the syna-
gogue of Satan) and at the same time to speak of the church
of Christ on the ground of creation, beneficence, and preserva-
tion, but not on the ground of a union based on love, on which
ground it is called Christ’s church which he loved, that he
might present it as his bride without spot and to be cherished
