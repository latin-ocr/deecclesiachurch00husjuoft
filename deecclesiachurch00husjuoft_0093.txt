CHAPTER V

GOOD AND BAD IN THE CHURCH

IN answer to the proofs cited in Chapter ΙΙΙ, urging the
contrary to what is here laid down, this is to be said: To
understand them we must be on our guard to note that men
are said to be in holy church in different senses. For some are
said to be in it by virtue of an unformed saithl only, as are
reprobate Christians involved in sins, to whom the Lord said:
“Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
bid you?'' Luke 6 : 46. And of them he also said, “Many
will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy
by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons, and by thy
name do many mighty works? and then will I profess unto
them, I never knew you‚'' namely‚ as persons to be saved,
Matt. 7 : 22. Hence Psalm 6 τ 9 says: “Depart from me all
ye workers of iniquity.''

Some are in the church only according to present faith

¹ Fides informis, as opposed to fides formata, that is, saith working by love,
or, as we might say, intellectual belief and living saith. The distinction of for-
mata and informis was first made by Peter the Lombard. In his Com. on Peter tlte
Lombard, Huss treats the subject at length, pp. 4 52-45 5, defining the different
sorts of saith. He says, to believe God, credere Deo, is to believe that the
things He says are true. Such saith the wicked have. To believe God, credere
Deum, is to believe that He is God. To believe in God, credere in Deum, is by
believing to love Him. The saith which the demons and bad men have is a
quality oi the intellect, but it is unformed, informis, saith because it is unac-
companied by love, and this unformed saith is an acquired habit and not a
habit infused from above. This fides informis precedes hope and love, but the
fides formata is contemporary with hope and love. Peter the Lombard, 4 z 23,
quotes Ambrose as saying: “Love is the mother oi all virtues, which forms all
within us—informat—and without which there is no virtue.” Luther de·
nounces this distinction as a pestilential ecclesiastical invention. Denffle, in
his Life of Luther, 1 : 637 sqq„ makes the astounding assertion that the saith
which Luther required was simply an intellectual assent—{aith without love and
the works oi love.
