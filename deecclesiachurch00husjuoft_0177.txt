CHRIST THE TRUE ROMAN PONTIFF 123

from us! Away with words which puff up vanity¹ and wound
love!'' From the words of this holy pope the deduction is
to be drawn that he may be easily puffed up who is called
most holy father, though he perhaps lives in sin and is struck
through with flattery or through ignorance lies.

Therefore‚ Gregory most notably says: “I desire not to
be advanced with words but by a good life.'' Alas! not thus
do modern pontiffs think who, destitute of good lives—
morals-—glory in a bare title, imagining to themselves that the
name, Holiness, befits them in virtue of their office or ecclesi-
astical dignity. But if this reasonjng held, then Judas would
have had to be called holy apostle. But blessed be the
Lord, who, in order to remove this cloak, said to his disciples:
“Have I not chosen you and one of you is a devil?’' John
6 : 70. This he said before Iscariot had betrayed his master.

Hence holy men, when they have been praised by men,
have humbled themselves and have burdened their minds
with sear, lest praise should cast them down from a merit
still more worthy. Therefore, Peter, Christ’s apostle, when
he was called by messengers went humbly to the Gentile,
Cornelius, and when he was on the way, Cornelius went to
meet him, instructed by an angel of Peter's holiness, and wor-
shipped at Peter’s feet. And Peter, taught of God about
Cornelius and assured through revelation of his blessedness,
did not permit Cornelius to lie at his feet as do modern pon—
tiffs in whom not a scintilla of holiness is seen. Nay, often
they are conscious of their sin in allowing themselves to be
reverenced and, on that account, make the more ostentation,
andis the ostentatious title—titulus pompositatis—be omitted,
they at once shake with anger.

¹ Vanitatem‚ Huss’s text has wrongly unitatem, unity. This famous letter
(see Mirbt, p. 77, for the full text), addressed to Eulogius, patriarch of Alexan<
dria, by Gregory the Great, 598, is a strong testimony, constantly appealed to,
against the exorbitant claims of the papacy. Six hundred years later, one of

gregory'zggccessors, Innocent ΠΙ, added to the other papal titles that of
