CHAPTER VI

CHRIST THE HEAD OF THE ELECT

TREATMENT having been made of the holy catholic church,
which is Christ’s mystical body and of. which Christ is the head,
a statement must also be made of the church of the wicked—
malignantium—which is the body of the devil, he being its
head} For St. Gregory says, M oralia, 4 ε 9 [Migne, 75 : 647]:
“As our Redeemer is one person with the assembly of the
good (sor He is the head of the body and we the body of that
head), so is the old enemy one person with all the company
of the reprobate, for he as their head presides over them unto
iniquity. Hence it is evident that all the reprobate constitute
one body. For Christ said to the Jews, the high priests and
Pharisees, who were called the chiefs——capitales—of the church:
‘Ye are of your father, the devil, and the lusts of your father
ye will do,''' John 8 ; 44. This shows that there must be one
generation—brood—which was bad in the case of the common
people‚ worse in the case oi secular rulers, but worst of all in
the case of the prelates, just as the generation of the righteous
has three opposite classes, corresponding grade for grade to
these three classes. If, therefore, the generation of the per-
verse is one, it is fitting that there should be one evil man
[being] with parts, who are the members of the devil. And as
there cannot be a head or a member except as these are related
to the entire body, it is plain that there is one body of the devil.

¹ In his Super IV. senc„ 36, 733, Huss also calls the kingdom of Satan ecclesia
malignancium, or civitas diaboli. “This is the congregation of all the damned, as
the holy church is the congregation of all the faithful—those who are to be

saved. In the present time this church of the wicked is dispensing its evil
odor and infection and the virus of salse doctrine.'’
