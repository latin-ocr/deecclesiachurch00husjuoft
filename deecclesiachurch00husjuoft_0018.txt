However, among the militant churches the Roman church is
the principal one.'' ¹

The church is not inerrant. One of the proofs given is
that the church chose Agnes, a woman, pope and consented
to be ruled over by her. Indeed, the Roman church with
the pope and cardinals may be transformed into Sodom,
but against the Church of Christ the gates of hell cannot

true officials, and only the authority of those prelates is to
be acknowledged, whose lives are in accordance with Christ's
precepts. The standard of judgment is found in the words,
“by their fruits ye shall know them,'' a passage Huss quoted
again and again.⁴1

All these assertions make straight in the direction of the
rights of private judgment. On that principle Huss justi-

would have many times been acephalous, without a head, as
in the interims between the death of one pontifi and the
election of his successor. The pope, so the doctors affirmed,
is the head of the whole militant church, its heart, its navel,
its unfailing fountain‚ and its all-sufficient refuge—caput, cor,
