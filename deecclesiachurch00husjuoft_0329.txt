CHAPTER XXIII
SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT

Now of suspension this is to be said that, in the state-
ment, to suspend is an administrative act or to prohibit any
good thing on account ot* a criminal offence. Hence, what the
old decretals call suspension the new law and decretals call
the interdict‚ and then they speak of ecclesiastical suspension
from an office or from a church benefice or of an ecclesias-
tical interdict from executing an office of the church.

This definition of suspension, therefore, being laid down,
it is to be noted that, just as it is proper in itself in the first
instance for God to excommunicate a man, so also it is proper
for Him in the first instance to suspend him. Hence it is
impossible for a pope or bishop to suspend any one justly,
except as he has been before suspended of God, just as it is
impossible for the pope to think anything righteously unless
the thought be before suggested of God. Hence the apostle
rightly says: “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to
think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God,’'
II Cor. 3 : 5. And the supreme Bishop himself said: “Apart
from me ye can do nothing,'' John 15 z 5. From this it is
clear that a suspension pronounced by a prelate is only
worth as much as God almighty makes it to be worth. Hence,
God's efficient suspension extends itself to priests, kings and
every one in authority whom He removes from office or whom
He takes from life by a decree of retribution. Hence, He
suspends any one from the sacerdotal dignity, as it is written:
“Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject
thee. Thou shalt be no priest to me,’' Hosea 4 ε 6; “Bring
no more vain oblations,'' Isaiah 1 : 13; and “I have no
