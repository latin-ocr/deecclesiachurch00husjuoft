226 THE CHURCH

clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves‚'' Matt. 7 ; 1 ς’.
Thirdly, he ought to examine and judge that the superior
may attend to spiritual offices and bodily nourishment or
other good works to be done. For not otherwise should
clergymen ever be chosen by laics as their curates and con-
