144 THE CHURCH

ing they come into the pope's presence clad in the most
splendid apparel, and attended with the most sumptuous
retinue of horsemen--thus attended, not on account of the
distance of place or difficulty of the journey but to show
their magnificence to the world and their contrariety to
Christ and his apostles‚ who went about among the towns,
cities‚ and castles clad in humble garb, on root, preaching—
evangelizando—the kingdom of God.1

Nor in this are they the true and manifest vicars of Christ
that they permit themselves to be adored of men on bended
knee or that they surround the pope with visitors from
abroad, that while he sits on high, splendidly apparelled
even down to his feet, yea and far beyond his chair, they
with bended knee humbly seek the kisses of his blessed feet,
as if the sanctity of this father, the pope, would descend even
to the place where his foot is planted? But do they, them-
selves weak‚ receive from those feet health? For Christ
suffered his feet to be kissed by a woman, but did not pro-
trude thern, as appears in Luke 7, because sincere contrition
and the care and washing of Christ's feet, that is, of the
poor, deletes the sins of pilgrims. But that kiss profits no
part [of the body] unto salvation. For, he who kisses‚ moved
by guilty greed or sear or flattery, or deceived by blind de-
votion, will be altogether chargeable with guilt, he bending
his knees and approaching the pope's feet2 more solicitously
and reverentially than he would do before the sacrament

¹ In his Postilla, Doc., 729 Huss said: “Jesus went about preaching on foot,
and did not drive about in a splendid carriage as nowadays our priests drive.
Ι, alas, also drive about . . . and Ι (10 not know whether it will be a sufficient
excuse in the future that I have not been able to cover the long distances on
foot and with sufficient speed.''

2The emperor Caligula seems to have been the first Roman emperor to
introduce the custom of kissing the foot from the East. The pope wears a
red supper, but when the custom of kissing his feet entered is not known. In
the Address to the German Nobility Luther denounced the custom whereby
‘a poor sinful man suffers his foot to be kissed by one who may be a hundred
times better than he.’ In chapter XXI Huss again refers to the custom of

adoring the pope.
