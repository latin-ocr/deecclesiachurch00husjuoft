heed to the popular mode of speech and the popular notion
of the militant church. Hence it was stated above that St.
Augustine said [Dist. 4 ε 8, de Pen.‚· Friedberg‚ 1 :1232]:
“If they have not perseverame, that is, if they do not abide
in that for which they started out to be, then they are not
truly called what they are called, and they are not what they
are called. For these things do not exist for Him who knows
what they will be in the future, that is, evil persons who have
proceeded from being good''——ex bonis mali. This saying of
Augustine should stand against all objections wherein am-
biguity is to be noted.
