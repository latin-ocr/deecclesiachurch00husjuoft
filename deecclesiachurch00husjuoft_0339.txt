 

SUSPENSION AND THE INTERDICT 283

And he proceeds after this fashion: He infames Christ’s
disciple, later accuses, and then cites him, excommunicates
and suspends him, and, if he cannot bring him into prison
or death, he then invokes the secular arm and, if he
cannot vanquish him in this way, he superimposes by his
wickedness the interdict. Chiefiy, however, he proceeds in
this fashion against those who lay bare the malignity of
antichrist, who has monopolized the clergy in largest mea-
sure for himself. Therefore, he launches these censures for
the sake of his clergy, notably those engaged in litigation out
of greed for benefices and at such times as the people have
not given their tithes according to promise, or in case the
prince has seized or received the temporal things, or if any
cleric—even though he be the most iniquitous thies or other-
wise taken in crime—has been held in custody by the secular
authorities, or if a priest has been wounded to the shedding
of blood, or even when the people lawfully have withdrawn
for a time their obedience from their prelates. But Christ,
the high priest‚ when the prophet was imprisoned‚ than whom
no greater has arisen born of women, did not impose the
interdict‚ nay not even when Herod beheaded him. Yea,
when he himself was stripped‚ beaten and blasphemed by
the soldiers, scribes, Pharisees, officers, and priests, not even
then did he pronounce any malediction, but he prayed, say-
ing: “Father forgive them, for they know not what they
do,'' Luke 23 ι 34. And this doctrine he gave to his mem-
bers, saying: “Love your enemies, do good to them that
hate you, and pray for them that persecute you, that ye
may be sons of your Father which is in heaven, for He mak-
eth His sun to rise on the good and the evil, and sendeth
rain on the just and the unjust‚'' Matt. 5 : 44, 45.

Therefore‚ following this doctrine in word and work,
Christ's first vicar, the Roman pontifi, also taught the faith-
ful, saying: “Hereunto were ye called, because Christ also
suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow¹
