of such statements‚ Huss affirms that the doctors treated the
Roman pontiff as a fourth person in divine things and placed
him on an equality with the Holy Spirit.1

In the course of his discussion on the papal office, Huss
presents the following views:

The rock upon which the church is built, Matt. 16 ε 18,
is Christ and not Peter.2 The Apostles called Christ the
foundation. To Christ, not to Peter, did the patriarchs look
forward3 and the early Christians did not base their saith
on the Apostle.

The Roman pontifi shares authority with other bishops
of the church, as Peter shared authority with the other
Apostles. Christ did not give the care of all the sheep to
Peter even as he did not exclusively give him the power to
preach and administer the sacraments.³

The word pope is not a Scriptural word and in the early
history of the church there were a number of popes.4 Orig-
inally all bishops were called popes, and these were equally
the immediate vicars of Christ.

The pope is not infallible. In matters of saith popes
may err and have erred—salli et fallere possunt. They may
be led astray by avarice or be deceived by ignorance.⁵

The pope may also be a heretic and, as a matter of fact,
before the fifteenth century there had been both wicked
men and heretics on the papal chair. Here Huss drew for
