CHRIST THE ONLY HEAD OF THE CHURCH 37

Peter and Paul were unrighteous; therefore, according to
present grace, they were not righteous. This conclusion is
true. As it was properly conceded that they were righteous
according to the grace oi predestination and were not righteous
according to present grace, so, in a similar way, Paul was one
of the faithful in view of predestination and one of the un-
faithful by reason of his persecution, an Israelite by predes-
tination and a blasphemer by the law of present unrighteous-
ness, was in the love of predestination and yet was without
grace, that is, without the love of present righteousness.

Paul's own words, drawn from Hosea, confirm this: “I
will call that my people which was not my people‚ and her my
beloved that was not my beloved3 and her to have acquired
mercy which did not acquire mercy, and in the place where it
was said unto them, Ye are not my people‚ there shall they
be called the sons of the living God‚'' Romans 9 z 25, 27.
Hence it is evident that this Scripture and other Scripture
like it are not understood except by those who know that there
is not a contradiction, unless opposites are predicated of the
same person according to the same thing and for the same
instant of time. Those who know how to carry on such dis-
cussion acknowledge that Christ was both dead and alive
during the three days; yea, as Ambrose says: “He was dead
and was not dead, for he lived in the spirit and was dead in
the flesh; died as a man and did not die as God.” So the
apostle says, Ι Tim. 5 : 6, that “a widow living in pleasure is
dead while she liveth,'' because she lives in the flesh but does
not live in the spirit. It is clear that neither what is contrary
nor sels-contradictory follows.

F mally, to sum up what has been said, it is evident that
no reprobate is truly a part of holy mother church. For, if
St: Thomas¹ or any one else should be found to call a repro-
bate who is in grace a member of the church, then he is speak-
ing ambiguously with Augustine and sacred Scriptum, giving

¹Thomas Aquinas, the angelic doctor, d. 1274.
