THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH 3

Christ.’' Likewise Acts 20 : 28: “Take heed to yourselves
and to the whole flock in which the Holy Spirit hath made
you bishops, to seed the church which he hath purchased with
his own blood.'' And in this sense, all the righteous now
living under Christ's rule in the city of Prague, and more par-
ticularly the predestinate‚ are the holy church oi Prague, and
the same is true of other particular churches of saints of which
Ecclesiasticus 24 : 2, speaks: “In the congregations—ecclesiis
—of the Most High shall she [wisdom] open her mouth,'' and
also 31 ε 11: “All the congregation of the saints shall declare
his alms.⁷' ¹

But the holy catholic—that is, universal—church is the
totality of the predestinate—omnium predestinatorum univer-
sitas—or all the predestinate,2 present, past, and future. This
definition follows St. Augustine on John, C. Reczm 32 :4
[Friedberg, 1 : 1126]‚ who shows how it is that one and the

the world, runs on to the apostles, and thence to the day of
J’udgment. For Augustine says: “The church which brought

² Huss takes up the decree of predestination in his Super I V. Seni„ 153—188.
He makes a slight distinction between elect and predestinate‚ although he says
the Masters use the terms interchangeably. Election may only be for the pres-
ent life, as in the case of Judas, of whom Christ said: “ Did not I elect you twelve,
yet one of you is a devil?’' John 6 : 70. The predestinate cannot fall, and
yet no necessity is placed upon their free will, pp. 165, 168.
