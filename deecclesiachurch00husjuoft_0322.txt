pation in the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. “The
cup of blessing which we bless‚ is it not the communication
of the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break, is
it not the participation of the body of the Lord?'' I Cor.
10 ε 16. Because we, being many, are one bread and one
body, seeing we partake of one bread and one cup. The
third communication or communion is the participation in
suffrages.1 In this participation the good Lord is glorified:
“I am a companion of all them that fear thee and that keep
thy commandments,’' Ps. 119 :63. And besides this three-
fold communication is the communication which is the inter-
course between all Christians‚ good and bad. The first three
are only participated in by good men, but of this fourth men
of the world think more.

Secondly, it is to be noted that in this statement I speak
of excommunication‚ as it corresponds to the fourfold excom-
munication just spoken of, namely‚ separation (1) from par-
ticipation in divine grace which makes gracious‚ (2) from a
worthy participation in the sacraments, (3) from participa-
tion in the suffrages which prepare for the life eternal—these
three being opposed to the corresponding threefold communion
—and (4) from intercourse with Christians, either by the
censure of the spiritual or public exclusion by the secular
judge.

From these it follows: (1) that there is not and can never
be an excommunication of the three first kinds except for
mortal sins. This is clear, because never is any one separ-
ated from the communion of the saints, which is the partic-
ipation in God’s grace, and the sacraments and the suffrage5‚
preparing for the life eternaL except for mortal sin. For
mortal sin alone divides or separates from communion of
this kind, just as it separates from God himself. Nor can
this happen except through mortal sins, because, so long as

¹ Suffrages are the prayers of the church and other benefits accruing from

the acts of the church in the mass and indulgences. See Hergenrother: K .-
