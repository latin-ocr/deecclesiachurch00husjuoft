OBEDIENCE TO PRELATES 247

the Golden-mouthed refused to enter the college of the
council assembled together against him.” These things are
found at the place [Friedberg‚ 1 : 519] where Gratian draws
the following conclusion:l “Outside the limits of his province
no man charged with guilt is under any circumstances to be
summoned.'' Hence Pope F abian,2 3 : 6 [Friedberg, 1 z 519],
says: “The case is always tried there where the offence oc-
curred, and he who does not prove his accusation should him-
self suffer the punishment he would inflict.'' Likewise Pope
Stephen‚³ 3 :6 [Friedberg, 1 ε 519]: “No permission to ac-
cuse shall be proceeded with outside of the bounds of the
provinces, but every charge is to be heard within the prov-
ince.'' The same thing appears, 3 :6 [Friedberg, 1 : 523]
from the action of the Roman synod.

Therefore, what would be the nature of such obedience, or
what reason would there be for it, that a person cited three
hundred miles away—to the pope unknown, accused by ene-
mies—should go with such concern to himself through enemies
and come to hostile judges and witnesses and consume ex-

¹ This quotation from the canon law givos only a part of the original and,
as Huss's text has several mistakffl, I have followed in the translation the
text of the canon law. Gratian’s conclusion, which Huss quotes, opens a new
section of the canon law and is preceded by another statement by Gratian
which it seems strange Huss did not quote as it is so apposite to what he has
been saying. It runs: “Although a man’s guilt be evident‚ yet is he not to
be condemned on the accusation of an enemy.'’ John the Golden—mouthed‚ to
whom Huss refers, is chrysostom, patriarch of Constantinople, d. 407, the great-
aet preacher of the early church. The synod to which Huss refers was held
403 and is called the synod of the Oak. It was held under the direction of
Theophilus of Alexandria, his enemy, and was made up largely of Chrysostom’s
enemioe or disaffected members of his clergy. Chrysostom refused to attend
unless his enemjee were expelled. The court whom he had offended by his
condemnations of extravagance in dress, etc., then deposed Chrysostom from
his see.

² Fabian, pope, 236-250, seems to have been a vigorous administrator, in
whose reign the schism of Hippolytus was completely put down and the Decian
persecution vigorously resisted in Rome.

³ Stephen Ι, pope, 254—257, in the dispute with Cyprian of Carthage over
the baptism by heretics took ground in favor of its validity.
