INTRODUCTION

Or the writings os John Huss of Bohemia, the Treatise
cm the Church is the most important.¹ From its pages the
charges were drawn upon which the author was pronounced

made its rector, holding the position six months and later,

Huss’s main treatise attacking John XXIH’s bulls of indulgences and his Reply
to the Eight Doctors, Monumenta, 1 ε 215-237; 366-402‚ are more spirited and
make the impression oi being more direct, because they are less encumbered

by quotatious from the canon law and other sources.
