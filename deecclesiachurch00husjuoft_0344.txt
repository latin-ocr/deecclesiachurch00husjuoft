290 THE CHURCH

ter, says concerning these words of St. Augustine: “That
that bishop had excommunicated Clazianus’s whole family
for Clazianus’s sin, and that seemed to him the right thing
to do, because one is sometimes punished with corporal pun-
ishment for the sins of another and also because some priests
of great name have excommunicated certain persons for sins
not their own. In the first part of the chapter Augustine
asks of him [Maximus] the cause and reason of his judgment.
Later he teaches that none of the reasons aforesaid suffice
to confirm his sentence. Third1y‚ he comes down to the spe-
cific act itself and proves that the sentence issued against
the family of Clazianus was unjust. And, finally, he advises
the bishop that if he is not wiHing to give a reason for the
judgment, he ought to abandon his error and follow the
truth.'' Thus far the Gloss.

Would, therefore, that those who excommunicate would
heed the saying of St. Augustine together with the Gloss,
and also they who impose a general interdict for the sake of
a single man in the church or the state. Why do they af-
flict with excommunication and the interdict a community
which is not guilty and altogether deprive the good and de-
voted presbyters of the exercise of the divine ministry and
God's devoted people of the sacraments and God Himself‚ who
is therein set forth, of honor, the dead of burial, and often in-
fants of baptism, without which they pass away and are
damned, according to the judgment of Augustine? Here the
Gloss of the Decretum says on these words: “In case one soul
through this severity, by which that whole household was
anathematized, should perish, passing out of the body without
baptism, the death of innumerable bodies, if innocent men are
violently removed from the church, is not to be compared with
this injury.'' The Gloss, Argumentum, says: “Greater is the
sin if one soul perish through the sin of unbelief than if they
should put to death the bodies of innumerable martyrs for
God's sake.’' This seems to correspond to the very letter,
