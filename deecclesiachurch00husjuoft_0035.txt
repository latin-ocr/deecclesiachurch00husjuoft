works and d'Ailly pursued the same method with Ockam's
Dialogus.¹

Huss's Commentary on the Sentences os Peter the Lombard‚
recently published in a volume of eight hundred pages, has
re-established the author’s claims to be a sane and well-
balanced theological student. Here he expresses himself
independently and shows himself conversant with those
phases of theological thought which were a subject oi special
discussion in his day as well as with the fundamental catholic
principles.²

Comparing the two treatises on the church along gen-
eral lines this may be said:

Huss is the more clear and direct of the two writers. Much
as he seems to repeat himself, he nevertheless pursues a defi-
nite aim. Wyclif, as was his custom‚ was drawn aside by the
exuberance of his intellect into all sorts of discussions ger-
mane and not strictly germane. His treatise has extended
paragraphs on canonizafflon, mathematics, alms, relic worship,
the evils of ecclesiastical endowments.³ He shows his scholas-
tic bent by that peculiar use of Latin terminology charac-
teristic of mediaeval scholasticism. Although Huss employs
some of Wycffl’s characteristic words, as antonomasia, yet
he is comparatively free in this respect:¹

¹Schwab, J. Gerson, p. 121, says that Gerson⁷s Declaratio compendiosa,
etc„ Du Pin, 2 : 314-318‚ is a literal copy—wortlich—of chapters XVI-XX
of Langenstein's Consilium pacis de unione et reform. eccles. Tschackert‚
P. d’Ailli‚ p. 43, says οἱ d‘Ailly that he copied Ockam almost literally—fast
wortlich.

²Flajshans, Super IV. Sententiarum, Prague, 1905. In his Introduction
F lajshans, a liberal Catholic‚ pronounces Huss Bohemia’s chief religious char-
acter. On the appearance οἱ this work Loserth declared that his former J’udg-
ment disparaging Huss’s originality would have to be revised.

³De Eccles.‚ 445qq., 97 sqq„ 162 sqq.‚ 274 sqq„ 465 sqq. In saying this,
however, the occasion which led to the composition of Wyclif's work must
be taken into account, that is the case of alleged sacrilege committed in Waet-
minster Abbey. See Loserth's Introd. to his ed.

⁴ See the glossary in Wyclif’s de dom. civ„ ed. by Poole, pp. 479-483. Of
the one hundred and fifty-nine words there given, Huss seems to use only
seven in his de Eccles.
