CHRIST THE ONLY HEAD OF THE CHURCH 35

sels from eternity has chosen every member of his church into
the bridal relation. Therefore he will desert no such member;
because, if this were not 50, he would choose without foresight
and proper provision to glory. And to this the conclusion of
the great philosopher applies when he says of the reprobate
who abode for a time in grace: “If they had been of us, they
would have continued with us,'’ I John 2 : 19. For this con-
ditional clause cannot be impossible or heretical‚ for it is
formulated by the Holy Spirit. To this text may be added
Matt. 10:20, “It is not ye who speak, but the Spirit of
your F ather which speaketh in you''; and also Romans 8 : 35,
where the apostle‚ as I have quoted above, speaking of him-
self and of the predestinate who are members of the church‚
proves that no creature shall be able to separate them from
the love which is in Christ Jesus. And he gathers his mem-
bers together gently, for the love of predestination does not
fail, I Cor. 13. Hence the apostle says: “Ye are not in the
flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth
in you. But if any one hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is
none of his‚'' Roman 8 : 9. And he understands that such
an one is not a part of his body.

And if, after all, it be objected that the reprobate living
in this present time in love has this bond [of perfectness] and
consequently is united with Christ, and the predestinate
living in sin lacks this bond and consequently is not united
with Christ, it is evident that, as in the human body there
is fiuid moisture and a radical moisture, so in Christ's mystical
body there is, so it must be granted, a grace according to
present righteousness and also a perfecting grace. As ulcers
develop and display themselves through the moist fluid and
are not continuous on account of a difference of nature [from
the body itself], so for the present it is with the members of the
devil who are known according to present righteousness. But
the predestinate, although they may be for a time deprived
of fluent grace, nevertheless have radical and abiding grace,
