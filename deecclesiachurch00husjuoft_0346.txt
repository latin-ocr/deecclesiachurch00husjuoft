292 THE CHURCH

Lord Zbynek‚ the archbishop of Prague, to secure a bull from
Pope Alexander that in the chapels the Word of God should
not be preached to the people. And from this bull I have

method of reasoning that is! “Here only things indifferent
are commanded.'’ O doctors, of what church is this the

Michael posted up charges against him and went about stirring up the members
of the council against him.
