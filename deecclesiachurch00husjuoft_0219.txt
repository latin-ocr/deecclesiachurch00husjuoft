THE LAW OF GOD 165

Certainly Ι confide in this expounder, so far as this opin-
ion goes‚ more than in all the aforesaid doctors. For Lyra
aptly draws from Scripture (1) that the opinion of no man,
whatever his authority may be—and consequently the opinion
of no pope—is to be held if it plainly contains falsehood or
error. It seems to me to be certain that Palecz and Stanis-
laus are so afraid of the pope and the cardinals that they
would not dare publicly to avow this holy saying. (2) Lyra
declares that God's law is the standard according to which
individual judges and especially ecclesiastical judges ought
to pronounce sentence and not otherwise. For this law shows
what ought to be accepted as true. Hence he says that this
appears from the words: “They shall pronounce for thee a
sentence of truth.'' And the words follow: “They shall
teach thee according to His law.’' O doctors‚ why do you
not hold to this Scripture? You were asked and for God’s
sake publicly besought in the convocation of the university to
pronounce a sentence of truth according to God’s law, whether
the bulls for the raising of the cross obligated the scholars
of the university to give of the goods collected by God sub-
sidies to the pope against Ladislaus and against his allies at
the pope’s command.l And you responded that you did not
comment on all the books of the Bible. He was much used by the Reformers.
especially Luther‚ so that it was said: “ If Lyra had not harped, Luther would
not have danced.’' Lyra quotes Raschi at length on the O. T.

¹ Ladislaus, king of Names, by occupying the city of Rome, called forth
against himself the severaet papal censuros from John XXIII. John’s two bulls
calling for a crusade against the refractory prince promised full forgiveness
from “ guilt and punishment’' to all who went to the holy war or helped others
to go. Three places were set up in Prague where the pardons were sold. Huss
lifted his voice and used his pen against the crusade as Wyclif had done against
the crusade preached by Henry de Spenser. Palecz and seven other members
of the theological faculty of the university, that is, the Eight Doctors, took
sides against Huss and defended John's bulls. Huss took the ground that
the pope has no right to forgive sins unless he surely knows that God in these
cases has forgiven, that the pope does no more than announce God’s decisions,
and that, instead of calling upon Christians to make war against Christians,
he ought to imitate Christ, who did not call down fire upon his enemies,

and with tears and prayers seek to overcome opposition to the church. Huss,
in his Reply to Palecz, Mon„ 1 : 3 30, says that Palecz was at first opposed to
