48 THE CHURcH

pay to it the material gifts due, such as oblations and tithes,
and in consequence inordinate confusion would follow in the
church militant.

Here, by way of denying the antecedent statement, it is
said: An instance is furnished in the case of Judas, chosen for
the service of the episcopate by Christ, who could not err.
For that reprobate never was Christ’s true disciple, as Augus-
tine shows, but a wolf clad in sheep’s clothing, and he was al-
ways chaff and a grain of weed or tares. Similarly, the second
part of the antecedent is denied. For the church is by an-
tonomasia called the bride of Christ, which is the totality

totality is in the highest sense the bride of Christ, then the

observing the traditions of their own making, and asserting
that they had God for their Father and that they were of
Abraham's seed, and at no time served any man and en-

called the holy church, inasmuch as Christ himself said of
them, Matt. 15 ε 14, that the disciples should allow thern to
take offense, because “they were blind leaders of the blind,''
so also it is certain that a particular multitude of the clergy
is not the holy church simply because it chooses to affirm it-

not follow. In the first, the inference was drawn [that the
clergy is the church] because otherwise it would follow that
Christians would not be able to recognize their mother. For
we must know our mother by saith, just as we know the
church triumphant, Christ and also his mother by faith, and
likewise Christ's apostles and all the blessed angels and the
