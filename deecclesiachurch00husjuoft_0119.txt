ROMAN PONTIF F AN D CARDINALS 65

lieving Jews, as the apostle says, Romans 11 ε 2, 12. (2) A
larger multitude of martyrs triumphed there than in any other
city, for so, where a man is born from the womb and triumphs
gloriously, from that place he takes his name. Inasmuch,
therefore, as holy church, so far as many of its parts go, was
born in Rome, having been gathered out of the womb of the
synagogue‚ and there triumphed, growing among the nations,
so it was thought proper that she should take her name from
the metropolitan city which is Rome. Hence Dist. 22 [Fried-
berg, 1 : 74] runs: “She is called most holy, because Peter
and Paul on the same day and at one and the same time con-
secrated the whole Roman church and exalted her above all
other cities in the whole world by their presence and by their
glorious triumph.'’ (3) Not the locality or the antiquity,
but the formulated faith establishes the church of Christ, for,
both as regards personalities and time, Christ's church had
existed before in its earlier seats. And in this sense it is said:
“The Lord did not choose people on account of the place,
but the place on account of the people‚'' II Mace. 5 z 19. For
this cause, I believe it is permitted to name Christ's church
from any locality which the righteous faithful inhabit‚ just
as Christ was called the Nazarene on account of his concep-
tion which occurred in Nazareth, and as he may be called a
Bethlehemite from the place of his nativity, and a Caper-
naumite from Capernaum where he worked miracles, and a
Jerusalemite from his most glorious passion in Jerusalem.

In view of these things it is plain what ought to be said
with regard to the doubtful statement made at the beginning
of this chapter. For it should be granted that the Roman
church is the holy mother, the catholic church, the bride of
Christ. To the argument in favor of the opposite, by which
it is argued that the Roman church is the church of which
the pope is the head and the cardinals the body—this is said
by way of concession and by defining the church in the second
way, that is, as the pope—whoever he may be—-in conjunction
