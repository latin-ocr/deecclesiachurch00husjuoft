 

THE LAw OF Gon 175

it is written: “O my people, they that call thee blessed,
they deceive thee, and destroy the way of thy paths. The
Lord standeth to judge,'’ Isaiah 3 ε 12. For, if those learned
in the law would boldly speak the truth about the pope and
the cardinals and not flatter them out of sear or in hope of
promotion to benefices, then the popes might at times recog-
nize themselves and not allow themselves to be venerated
as gods. But, because both parties sin in hypocritically re-
joicing over honors and beatification [allowing themselves to
be called and treated as blessed], and are tickled over such
lying adulation, so necessarily both parties shall be hurled
down. For the prophet says, Isaiah 9: 16: “They that
bless this people and lead them astray and they that are
blessed will be hurled down.'' And who these are, the prophet
shows in the verses immediately preceding: “The Lord
will destroy in one day from Israel head and tail, crooked
and refractory. The elder and honorable man, he is the
head and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.'' Lo,
the one prophet expounds the head and the tail. Let him,
therefore, that will, take note that he is called honorable
and elder father whom they call head. And with probabil-
ity it may be said of every pope, from the first one to the
last, who lives at variance with Christ and whom they have
called or will call head and holy father—that he is that hon-
orable and elder one, because this succession began a long
time ago. But the tail, which by fiattery or false show or
by vain excuses covers the works of that elder father, and
the prophet who teaches lim, represent the learned clergy
which teaches that the pope is neither God nor man but a
mixed God or an earthly God and also teaches that the
pope is able to give me another's good and that I will be
saie, because the pope is able to depose a bishop without
cause, is able to dispense at variance with the apostles' teach-
ing, at variance with his oath, his vow and with natural law,
and no one has a right to say to him, Why doest thou this?
