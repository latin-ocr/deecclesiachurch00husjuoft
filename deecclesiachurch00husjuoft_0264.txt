210 THE CHURCH

milk and wool of Christ's sheep, and do not minister the things
due from the pastoral office for the working out of the eternal
salvation of Christ's sheep. For the non—performance of pas-
toral ministries is, by Scripture testimony, the killing and per-
dition of Christ’s sheep. And that these two classes of sins,
although they are distinguished, are the very worst, and
every other class of sin inestimably excels them, is clear
from this that, although distinct and dissimilar, they are di-
rectly contrary to the very best things. For that is the worst
which is contrary to what is best, etc. And because, in good
things, the cause of the good is better than the thing caused;
and, in evil things, the cause of the evil is worse than the thing
caused—it is clear how those who introduce into the church
of Christ those worst murderers of godlikeness and divinity
among Christ's sheep are still worse than those worst mur-
derers themselves, and more like Lucifer and antichrist
than they. And in this gradation of badness those do more
abundantly excel who, in view oi the greater and the di-
viner power given them for edification and not for scatter-
ing the sheep, are the more held by the church of God in
duty bound to exclude and exterminate those worst mur-
derers.'' Thus much he of Lincoln.

He wished briefly to establish that the killing and driv-
ing to perdition of Christ's sheep are the two worst sins,
although they may be distinguished, even as the making alive
of the sheep by grace and their glorification are the two best
things for the sheep, although different, and to them the killing
and the destroying are opposites. And as killing is the oppo-
site of making alive and murder of glorification, it follows that
by as much as these two sins are more serious by so much are
they opposed to the good things which are more excellent.
And, as God of himself is the cause of these good things, it
follows that by as much as the killers and murderers of the
sheep are worse than others, by so much are the killing and
murdering of the sheep the worse sins. And it is clear that
