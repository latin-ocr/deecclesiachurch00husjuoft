 

HUSS'S RESISTANCE TO THE POPE 189

also said, “Why do ye also transgress the commandments of
God, because of your traditions‚'’ Matt. 15 : 3, and, “We
must obey God rather than men,'' Acts 5 : 29.

Hence, whenever obedience is rendered to man rather
than God, as Adam obeyed Eve, then it is always evil obe-
dience, so that every one obeying evilly is disobedient to God;
and so it is that the same man may be obedient and disobe-
dient, with respect to the different persons commanding or
to different commands. And it does not follow that, because
a beloved man¹ is disobedient, therefore he is not obedient,
but it does follow that the man is not obedient to him with
respect to whom he is disobedient or with respect to whose
commands he is disobedient. And it is clear that to obey
in one's brotherhood [religious community] is to fulfil the will
of the one giving commands, and this is well, as when a man
or a created spirit living in grace fulfils the lawful will of
the one giving commands. But to obey is bad when either
living in sin one fulfils the will of a superior as to a given
command, as when one who lives in luxury, fasts from re-
spect to the command3 or, secondly, when one fulfils a bad
command against God. In view of these things it is clear
that it is impossible for a rational creature to be virtuous
morally unless he is obedient to his God.

And so it must be known that, according to St. Thomas
[Aquinas] 2:104, art. 5 [Migne's ed., 3 : 7ς>8],2 obedience
is threefold, namely‚ sufficient, perfect and unreasoning. Suf-
ficient obedience is that which obeys only in those things
where the obligation is of natural law and does not go be-

¹ “ Beloved man,'' literally, Sortes, an abbreviation for Socrates and a general
term common with writers in the Middle Agae for a person dear to us. Huss
usae it in his de Corpore, Flajshans, ed., p. 22, and very frequently in his Com.
on the Lombard’s sentences. “This human speci& is Sortes [Socrataeh this
Plat0,’' p. 47. “Sortes and Plato are one and the same thing, res—and so do
not really—‘realiter—differss' p. 54. ‘⁴ The body of Christ is not in the sacrament
as Sortae is in a definite place and only in one place at one time,” p. 566, etc.

²The distinction is taken from Th. Aquinas. Huss givae in his own lan-
guage the substance of Thomas’s treatment.
