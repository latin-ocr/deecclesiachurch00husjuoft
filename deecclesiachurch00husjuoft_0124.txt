70 THE CHURCH

in so far as he lacks saith. For, if he were mindful of the
penalty to be inflicted on those sinning in that way and
fully believed it and had the faith which comes from divine
knowledge—wherewith God knows all things clearly and is
present with such sinners-then, without doubt, he would not
sin mortal sin.

A person may lack faith in three ways: (Ι) By weak-
ness, and in this way he is lacking who vacillates in believing
and does not persist unto death in the defense of faith. (2)
He is lacking in faith who firmly believes the many things
which are to be believed and yet is lacking in many things to

arise in the day of judgment; and that God will finally re-
ward in bliss all the saints who finish this present life in grace.
(2) Hope does not reach the knowledge of faith in that which
it hopes for, but it rests in a certain middle act between doubt
and belief, so that there are many things which are to be set
before the faithful to accept which, when the distinction is
