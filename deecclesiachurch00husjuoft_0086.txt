32 THE CHURCH

bate eternal fire. Thus, the Psalmist [5 ε 6] says: “Thou
hatest all who work iniquity.'’ Hence, because the pride
of the reprobate, in proportion as they hate God, always
ascends after final impenitence, they are not of Christ's
body. For St. Augustine says: Sermon on the Lord's Words,
53 [Migne's ed„ 354, vol. 39 : 1568]: “A lowly head and a
proud member! Nay. He who loves pride does not wish to
be of the body of Christ the head.'' And again, Sermon 50
[Migne's ed„ 138, vol. 38 ε 765], he says: “Christ spoke truly
in regard to certain shepherds, for he holds all good shepherds
in himself, when he said: ‘1 am the chief Shepherd and all ye
are one in me.' 1 But the reprobate, who is a member of the
devil, is not duly joined together in the same structure with his
head.'’ Augustine also, de doct. Christi, 3 : 32 [Nic. Fathers,
2 : 569], after he shows that Christ and his body, which is the
church‚ are one person, censures Tychonius‚² who in his second
rule calls the whole human family the twofold—bipartitum—
body of the Lord. This, he says, “was no proper name to apply

to the body of Christ. That in truth is not the Lord's body
that will not be With him through eternity. Tychonius ought

¹ Huss’s text differs from Augustine’s‚ which runs: ego sum pastor bonus, etc.—
“1 am the good Shepherd. I am, I arn one. All are one with me in unity.
He who feeds apart from me, feeds against me. He who gathers not with me,
scattereth abroad. Hear how greatly this unity is commended! ‘ I have other
sheep which are not of this sold) ’¹ Augustine then goes on to say that “among
the nations there were predestinate persons. who were not of the people of
Israel according to the flesh. These will not be outside of that sold—ovile—
for he must bring thern also that there may be one flock—grex—and one shep-
herd.'' Here Augustine departs from the text of the Vulgate, which has unum
ovile—fold—in both places, and conforms to the Greek original, which has two
different words.

²Tychonius, a scholarly North African belonging to the Donatist party,
flourished about 400 and was an extensive author. Bede quotes him as es-
sentially orthodox except on the question of the Donatist schism. He departed
from the Donatist teachings‚ however, in denying the visible millennial reign
of one thousand years and in accepting non-Donatist baptism. Both he and
Augustine were involved in the confusion of identifying the true church with
a visible communion, although both made the church a mixed body. Tycho-
nius set forth seven rules of exegesis. Huss’s quotation is drawn from Augus-
tine’s treatment of the second rule. Tychonius’s Book os Rnles has been pub-
lished by Burkitt in Texts and Studies, 4 ε 1, 1894.
