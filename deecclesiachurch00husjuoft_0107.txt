CHRIST THE HEAD OF THE ELECT 53

When, however, the body of Christ is called the mystical
body on account of the mystery of the heavenly marriage
between Christ and the church‚ the body of the devil is not
likewise mystical but dark, because to be joined with the
devil as one of his members does not express itseli directly
in mystery but in the scourge. Thus the body of the devil
has something natural about it, because, as Augustine says,
de natura Boni, all evil must root itself in the good, so all evil
in morals is founded in what is good by nature. And besides
having that which is natural, the body of the devil has the
essence of vice, just as the mystical body of Christ has the
essence of virtue. Hence St. Augustine denies, de doct. Christi,
III [Nic. Fathers, 2 : 569], that the body and members of
Christ are one in the same sense as the members of the devil
are one.

Now, if it be asked what is the form in which the members
of the devil are united in that body, the answer is that there is
an outer form and an inner deformity. The outer form is
God's eterna] foreknowledge which knows and ordains all the
foreknown members of that diabolical body to be bound to
perpetual punishment. But the inner deformity is the final
disobedience or pride, which the saints call the guilt of final
impenitence or the sin against the Holy Spirit. And so the
same sin both continues on and disjoins. For it holds on in the
members of the devil, binding them together in their wicked-
ness for Tartarus and separating them from the compam‘on-
ship of the blessed, just as heat, first dissolving a mixture,
gathers together the homogeneous parts, making each element
of the dissolved mixture to seek its own place. But it sepa-
rates the heterogeneous constituents, when it dissolves what
seems on the surface to be harmonious by resolving the parts
of the mixture, each into its original, separate element. For
in the day of judgment, by the contrary principles, the cold-
ness of the devil's body and the heat of the love of Christ’s
body, the bipartite body must be dissolved according to the
