66 THE CHURCH

with the cardinals—-whoever they may be and wheresoever
they may live. But it is denied that this church is the holy,
catholic and apostolic church. And so both parts of the
argument are granted, but the conclusion is denied. But if
this be said, namely, “1 lay down that the pope is holy to-
gether with all the twelve cardinals living with him,'' this
being laid down and admitted as highly possible, it follows
that the pope himself in conjunction with the cardinals is
the holy‚ catholic and apostolic church. This conclusion is
denied, but it follows well that a holy pope in conjunction
with holy cardinals are a holy church which is a part of the
holy, catholic and apostolic church. Therefore Christ's faith-
ful must hold firmly as a matter of saith to the first conclusion
and not to the second3 sor the first is confirmed by Christ’s
words: “The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.’' But

the second is a matter of doubt to me and to every other pil-[ss

grim, unless a divine revelation makes it plain. Hence neither
is the pope the head nor are the cardinals the whole body of
the holy‚ universal, catholic church. For Christ alone is the
head of that church, and his predestinate are the body and
each one is a member, because his bride is one person with

Jesus Christ.¹

¹It was a popular definition which regarded the pope in conjunction with
the body of the cardinals as the church. So Wyclif‚ “the public—communitas
*holds the church to be the pope and the cardinals, which it is necessary for
all to believe.'' De Eccles., p. 92, and often. In his Replies to Palecz and
stanislaus, Huss represents these two magisters as defining the church in the
same way, the “pope is the head and the cardinals the body of the church.”
