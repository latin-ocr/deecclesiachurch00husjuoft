80 THE CHURCH

is the shepherd of shepherds3 if thou thinkest of the edifice,
Christ is the foundation of foundations.

And later he [Augustine] gives the reason for the prophets
and apostles being called the foundations oi the structure of
the city of Jerusalem, and asks: “Why are they the foun-
dations? Because their authority bears up—portat-—our in-
firmity. How are they gates—portae ? Because by them we
go into the kingdom of God‚ for they preach to us. And
as we go in by them, so we go in by Christ, for he is the

and Christ is the one gate and Christ is the twelve gates,
because Christ is in the twelve gates.'’ Thus much Augus-

the prophets in whose saith the apostles were grounded, for
from them saith passed on by succession to the apostles,
whose preaching had the same belief as had the prophets
who also said the same thing. Or let us accept the apostles
as the foundations in whom the whole fortification of the
church is grounded. Again‚ in this passage it is said: “All
the foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with a
precious stone, and the first foundation was jasper.'’ The
Gloss says: “The foundations, that is, the prophets and apos-
tles, are adorned in themselves with graces of every kind.''

the apostles are the foundations! Christ is by a figure of
speech—antonomastice—the foundation because the edifice of
the church begins from him and is finished in him and through
him. But the prophets and apostles are the foundations be-
cause their authority bears up our weakness. And this was the
sense intended by Ambrose when he said: “That Peter was
called the rock because he was the first to lay in the nations¹
the foundations of the saith ; and, like an immovable rock‚''
that is, by the steadfastness with which he endured to the
