 

THE LAW OF GOD 179

(5) A. D. 907 Pope Leo presided, and against him rose
up Christophorus.¹

(6) A. D. 968 a synod of bishops was collected from all
Italy, and Pope John was disgraced for nefarious crimes, and,
because he excused himself and delayed to come, another,
Leo, up to that time a layman, was made pope by a unani-
mous election and with the emperor’s consent. And so Leo
performed ordinations and djd other acts which were apos-
tolic. Not long afterward the Romans, proving faithless
to the emperor, received Pope John. He assembled a synod
and deposed Leo and set aside his acts, and it was decreed
by Leo that the synod was not to be called a synod but a
brothel because it favored adultery. Whoever, therefore,
were condemned by his decree were commanded to present
his proscription of them in a writing containing these things,

and seems to have been murdered.

² John XII, one of the dissolute popae, 9 5 5-964, was condemned by a Roman
synod for perjury‚ murder, sacrilege and almost every crime and his place
filled by the election of Leo VIII, but John was received again by the Roman
people. While the emperor Otto was on his way to Rome to settle matters,
John, as Huss says, was put to death while he was in the act of adultery, an
act worthy of Marozia, whose grandson he was.

³ Benedict V, 964—966. Leo VIII, at Otto I's instance, was elected pope.
After Otto’s departure from Rome, John XII entered the city and expelled
Leo. John djed 964, and the Romans elected Benedict V. The emperor set
