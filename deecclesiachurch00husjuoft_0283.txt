CHURCH OR ITS PRELATES

AGAIN, that the doctors in their double statement may be
better understood, since they say that “the Roman church
and the prelates are to be obeyed in all things by their in-
feriors‚'' etc.‚1 and again, “Therefore ought they to be obeyed
and submitted to,” I take it as true from the rules of grammar
that this complex statement “are to be obeyed⁷' means as
much as the complex expression, “ought to obey,’' and fur-
ther, that this word “ought'' expresses a debt of obligation
to obey under pain of mortal sin. This supposition appears
from the affirmation of the doctors derived from the words
of the Saviour: “All things whatsoever they bid you, these
do and observe,’' Matt. 23 : 3. For this word of the Lord
is a commandment. Secondly‚ this supposition appears from
the words of the doctors‚ when they say: “Certain of the
clergy in the kingdom of Bohemia who do not agree, striv-
ing, so tar as in their power lies, to lead the faithful people
to disobedience in respect to their prelates and to irrever-
ence for the papaL episcopal, priestly and clerical dignities.”
It is only noted that there would be mortal sin in disobedi-
ence, and irreverence would be mortal sin. Thirdly, this sup-
position appears from the assertion of St. Augustine, when
he says: “If thou art not obedient to thy father (under-
stand not thy bod-ily father but thy spiritual father) thou
hast lost all the virtues.'' In this way it is plain that a
virtuous man is not able to lose all the virtues except by

¹ In his de sex Erroribus, Huss has a chapter on obedience‚ M on„ 1 : 238 sq„
in which he denies that it is to be rendered in all cases to ecclesiastical superiors.
The terms, “inierim'’ and “subjects'' refer to ecclesiastical rank and orders.
