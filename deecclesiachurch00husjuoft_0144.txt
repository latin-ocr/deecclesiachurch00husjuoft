90 THE CHURCH

he serves himself rather than the sheep,l none the less he
leads an innumerable company of people in flocks with him-
self to be beaten together with himself, as the property of
hell, with many stripes throughout eternity.⁷' Nor is it nec-
essary to refer to many saints, for the Chief Pontiff‚ the holiest
of the holy said: “All that came before me are thieves and
robbers‚'’ John 10 ε 8. Again he said to his disciples: “Ye
are the salt of the earth3 but if the salt hath lost its savor,
wherewith shall it be salted . . . it is neither useful for the
land nor for the dunghill, but it is cast out,'' Matt. 5 : 133
Luke 14 ε 34.

Wishing to impose this judgment upon the minds of men,
that most good Saviour and best of masters immediately added:
“Who hath ears to hear let him hear.'' Therefore, let every
priest see to it, if he has entered well, that he live pure
of offense, with the sincere purpose of honoring God and
profiting the church, and in case he demean himself well,
that he lay little store by mundane honors and the world’s
lucre. For, otherwise, he is a lying antichrist‚ and the
higher his office the greater antichrist he is. Let the hum-
ble pilgrim look at Christ who said: “I am the way, the
truth, and the life,'' John 14 : 6. Behold he who wants to
go, hath the way, for Christ is the way, and whither he wants
to go, for Christ is the truth, and where he wants to abide,
for Christ is the life.
