OBEDIENCE TO PRELATES 249

namely, that Christ answered in person citations of this
kind. For, if popes would depend upon that law of Christ
as stated, Matt. 7 ε 12, “All things whatsoever ye would
that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them3
for this is the law and the prophets,'' I am of the opinion
that they would not with reason desire to cite men and
oblige them to make such a perilous and untried journey.
Therefore, why do they urge others without a patent and
reasonable cause to go to such pains and labor?

Oh that they would think of an exemplary lise Hved as set
forth according to the authority of the pontifi, Christ, who
piously went to see the erring and those oppressed by the
devfl, not by citing them to appear, not by excommunicating
them, nor by imprisoning them, or by burning them—and
who charged Peter and in him every one of his vicars, saying:
“If thy brother sin against thee, go show him his fault‚’'
etc. Here Peter's vicar should take note, first, that when
he wants to show a brother his fault, he ought to see first
that he himself is unblamable, for love ought to begin with

“Hypocrite, first cast out the bearn out of thine own eye and
then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy
brother's eye‚'' Luke 6 : 42. Or how may he condemn any
one to death, when the Saviour says: “He that is without
sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her,'' John 8 : 7.
In truth, if that law of Christ be thought of, rarely would
a prelate be found in these times who could lawfully correct
or condemn for heretical depravity.

Secondly‚ Christ's vicar should note how the Saviour
commands, saying, “Go‚'' for here he commands that judges
ought in telling subjects of their faults to visit the places
where the offence is said to have been committed, as even
law proclaims. For so did Christ and all his apostles. And
