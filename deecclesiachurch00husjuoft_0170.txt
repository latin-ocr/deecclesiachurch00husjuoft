1 1 6 THE CHURCH

fire upon my altar in vain! Ι have no pleasure in you, saith
the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your
hand.'' Behold how the Lord speaks to the wicked priests be-
cause they despise His name and offer polluted bread. Hence
Goegory, 1 : 1, Multi sec. [Friedberg‚ 1 ε 388], follows up his
statement about the sacraments and power by saying: “ So we
defile the bread‚ that is, Christ's body, when we approach un-
worthily the altar, and with filthy lips drink his pure blood.'’
And the apostle says: “He who despised Moses' law, died
without any mercy under two or three witnesses. Of how
much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy
who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and accounted
the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an un-
holy thing?’' Heb. 10 : 28, 29.

In the second place, such crucify the Son of God. For
the apostle says: “Crucifying to themselves afresh the Son
of God, they put him to an open shame‚'' Heb. 6 ε 6. Thirdly,
such deal wickedly with the law of Christ, of whom St.
Jerome in Sophoniam Proplz.‚ 1 :1 [Com. on Zephaniah,
F riedberg, 1 : 391], says: “The priests who minister in the
eucharist and distribute the Lord's fiesh to his people, deal
wickedly with Christ's law in thinking that the words of the
one who curses make the eucharist and not his life, and that
such a solemn address is all that is necessary and not the merits
of priests.'' Of these he says: “A priest who is assoiled by any
stain of sin should not approach the table to offer sacrifices
to the Lord.'' Fourthly, the persons spoken of above blas-
pheme the Lord's majesty. Hence we read: “Who walk
after the flesh in the lusts of defilement and despise damna—
tion,⁷' II Peter 2 : 10. Further on Peter says: “But these
as creatures without reason to be taken and destroyed, rail-
ing in matters whereof they are ignorant.'' On this point
St. Augustine‚ on Psalm 147 [Nic. Fatlzers, 8 : 6651, says:
“If thou dost exceed the due measure of nature by glutton-
ous immoderation and satest thyself with wine-bibbing, so
