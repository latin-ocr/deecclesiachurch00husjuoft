164 THE CHURCH

when he adds, “And they wish to interpret‚'’ because if he
is not a knower of hearts how does he dare to say that we
wish to expound Scripture otherwise than we ought? But
this statement is vented forth because we do not follow his
pleasure and the pleasure of his colleague Stanislaus‚ and
stand with them who deem themselves, with the doctors
agreeing with them, the wise in the church. And even much
more are they to be suspected of lying for they have not
dared to charge us with not giving heed to the interpreta-
tion of the holy doctors.

But they add the biggest lie of all when they speak with-
out applying the holy Scripture as written in Deut. 17 : 8-12.
For this these doctors ought to know that we turn to sacred
Scripture and affirm that it is the true Word of God, which
also confirms our judgment. For that diligent expounder of
Scripture, Nicholas os Lyra, on Deut. 17y says: “The opin-
ion of no man, whatever his authority may be, is to be held
if it plainly contains falsehood or error, and this appears by
the promise made in the text, ‘They shall pronounce for thee
a sentence of truth‚' and '‘ they shall teach thee according to
His law.' From this it appears that, if they said what was
false or plainly fell away from God’s law they were not to
be heard.'' Thus much Lyra. And what has been said is
confirmed by that word of the Lord: “Thou shalt not fol-
low the multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou acquiesce in
the judgment of the many to depart from the truth‚’' Ex.
2 3 : 2. On this Lyra says that in the Hebrew it runs: “Thou
shalt not fall away after the rabbins—that is, teachers or the
great men—to commit sin.'' And further on, he says: “As
you are not to fall away from the truth on account of the
larger number who sit in judgment, and fall away from the
truth, so you are not to fall away on account of those who
have greater authority in giving judgment.'' Thus much Lyra.¹
