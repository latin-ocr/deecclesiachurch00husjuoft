THE APOSTOLIC SEE 197

him to be a bishop, who desires pre-eminence.’'' Thus
much Augustine.

It being understood by general consent what an apostle
is, we can understand what “apostolic'’ means. For apos-
tolic means keeping the way of an apostle. Just as, there-
fore, a true Christian is one who follows Christ in his life,
so a truly apostolic man is the priest who follows the teach-
ing of the apostles, living the life of an apostle and teaching
his doctrine. Hence, any pope is to be called apostolic so
far as he teaches the doctrine of the apostles and follows
them in works. But, if he puts the teaching of the apostles
aside, teaching in word or works what is contrary, then he
is properly called pseudo-apostolic or an apostate. Hence
Dist. 97 [79 : 9, Friedberg, 1 : 278]: If any one shall be en-
throned in the papal seat on account of money or human
favor or by the help of a popular or military uprising, with-
out a harmonious and canonical election, he is not to be
considered apostolic but apostate. Since, therefore, the error
is greater in an active election when those electing are forced
by the devil to elect an individual whom God condemns—a
thing manifestly certain from his works and his neglect of
the spiritual office, that he is at variance with the life of the
apostles—much more does it follow that such an individual
is to be deemed not apostolic but an apostate.

Therefore, in view of these statements, the apostolic seat
may be called the life of the priest who efficiently maintains
the life of an apostle, just as the seat of an apostle is the
life of an apostle. Hence Chrysostom, Hom. 25, says [N ic.
Fathers, 10 : 395]: “That virtue of any apostle whereby he
may have been more perfect than the rest, that is his throne.
But all the virtues of Christ together are, as it were, one seat,
because he was equally perfect in all the virtues, and he
alone.” See how well that saint perceives that the individual
life of each of Christ's apostles is his seat in which he reposes
by reason of his merits and for which reason he now sits in
