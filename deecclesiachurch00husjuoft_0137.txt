THE CHURCH FOUNDED ΟΝ CHRIST 83

By what was said above in Chapters ΙΙ, III, IV, namely‚
that the holy universal church is one and consists of all the
predestinate that are to be saved and that Christ alone is
the head of the church‚ just as he alone is the most exalted
person in the church, imparting to it and to its members
motion and understanding unto the life of grace, so it is evi-

holy catholic church. And the dictum of St. Dionysius is
true, that Peter was the captain among the apostles and was
the foundation of churches, as is said in the next chapter
of the apostles. And the dictum of Augustine is also true,
that by a certain prerogative Peter was the first among the
apostles. And the dictum of Marcellus is also true, that

his teaching and example. But he was not a person higher
in dignity than Christ’s mother; nor was he equal to Christ

beyond Jordan to whom thou hast borne witness, behold
the same baptizeth and all men come to him,’' John an-
swered them and said: “A man can receive nothing except
it have been given from heaven. Ye yourselves bear me wit-
ness Ι have said I am not the Christ, but that I am sent
before him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but
