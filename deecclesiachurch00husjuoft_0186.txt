them by divine revelation. For neither by the bodily senses,
nor by the reason, nor from sacred Scripture do these points
appear. Yea, the doctors in making these points authori-
tative‚ so that they must be believed, are seen to be anath-
ema by the authority of Augustine himself which they
adduce in their writing. If any one venerate any other
scriptures than those which the catholic church has received
or has handed down to be held as authoritative, let him be
anathema. This is clear because these doctors have offered
their own writings as authoritative and to be believed and
the catholic church has not received them for they are found
neither in the divine law nor in the code of canons. Therefore‚
it follows that these doctors are themselves anathema, and
it is clear that religious faith is not held by them so far as
these points are concerned unless they prove them plainly
or show them to be founded in sacred Scripture or in clear
reasoning, for Augustine says, Ep. ad H ieron„ Decretum, Dist.

they seem to excel by sanctity or true doctrine but I will not
regard as true what they say because they have felt it to be
true, but because they have been able to convince me by other
writers, or by canonical or probable reasons, that they do
not differ from the truth.''

Inasmuch as these doctors are not writers of sacred Scrip-
ture—it being granted that they excel by their sanctity—-
the faithful are not, therefore, to think a thing is true be-
cause they feel it to be true unless by other writers of Scrip-
ture or for canonical or probable reasons they prove that
these points do not deviate from the truth. Then, similarly,
as to the point that the pope is always and uniformly to be
regarded as the head of the Roman church, and that the
