284 THE CHURCH

how many ways one may consent to the open sin of another,
for he consents who co-operates, who defends, who gives
counsel, and sanctions, and also who neglects to threaten
and rebuke.

Now, in regard to the interdict with which, on account
of the sin of a single man, or of a number, the clergy vex
Christ's common people—plebs.¹ For by the three censuros,
excommunication, suspension and interdict‚ for their own
exaltation they keep the laity at their feet, increase their
avarice, protect wickedness and prepare the way for anti-
christ. And all three censures they heap up on the ground
of [as a punishment for] disobedience in this way, that every
one that does not obey them and yield to their will, him
they excommunicate or suspend from office, and when he
continues to resist their will, they place the interdict over
the people‚ interdicting the exercise of divine services, the
display of the sacrament, burial—and these things they in-
terdict to men altogether righteous, that they may carry out
their will by the deliberate imposition of such burdens.

But this is an evident sign that these censures proceed
from antichrist; and these they call in their legal proceed-
ing fulminations when they are directed against those who
preach Christ's law and who show up the wickedness of the
clergy. A second sign is that these censures are multiplied on
account of disobedience done to themselves rather than on
account of disobedience done to God and, therefore, rather
on account of the injury done to themselves than for the in-
jury done to our God. For in this way the old enemy,
skilled in wickedness, proceeds, by exalting obedience to
antichrist above obedience to Christ, and so he usurps, for
disobedience to himself, that excommunication which Christ
instituted for disobedience to God.

¹Luther‚ in his Address to the German Nobility, called for the abolition of
the interdict altogether on the ground that it is a greater sin to silence God's
