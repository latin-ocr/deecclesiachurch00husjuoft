THE CARDINALS 143

bishop‚ a priest, or a cleric, and to act at variance with this
order.'’ Again, 2 : 1 [Friedberg‚ 1 : 438]. All prelates are
not to be esteemed as prelates. Not the name makes the
bishop, but the life. And, Dist. IV sub rubrica, under “He
is not truly a priest who is called a priest,'' Chrysostom also
says [Dist. 40 : 123 Friedberg, 1 : 147]: “There are many
priests and few priests.''

From these and other sayings it is evident that no pope
is the manifest and true successor of Peter, the prince of the

consume in luxurious living the goods of the poor, and if
they do not do miracles or preach the Word of God to the
people or pray sincerely or fill the place of deacons--whom
the apostles appointed, Acts 6—by not performing their du-
ties or living their lives—in how far, I ask, are they the vicars
of the apostles? In thjs that they heap up livings or, like
Gehazi, seize upon gists, or because very early in the morn-
