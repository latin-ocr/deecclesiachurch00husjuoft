2 50 THE CHURCH

so Christ will do at the last judgment, as he alone predicts
in Matt. 2 5. In the third place, let Peter's vicar or prelate
note how in the way of telling one's fault, he ought to be
prudent, diligent, and intent that he do not excommunicate
before the close of the third rebuke. Fourthly‚ he should
note the number of the faithful witnesses by whom the
brother’s offence is to be established. And fifthly, he ought
to tell it to the church‚ as one greater than himself, for so
the Lord bade Peter: “Tell it to the church.⁷'

From the things already said I summarize: that the
proposed excommunication does not concern me or bind me
because hostile judges and witnesses dwell in Rome and the
case chiefly is a matter touching the judge. The distance

by hostile Germans, I do not see any fruit of my appearance,
but, on the contrary, only neglect of the people in the Word
of God. I hope that Christ will guard me, as he said: “Be-

ye, therefore, wise as serpents and harmless as doves. But
beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and
in their synagogues they will scourge you,'’ Matt. 10 : 16, 17.
He also said: “Behold, I have told you beforehand. If, there-

go not forth: behold, he is in the inner chambers, believe it
not‚'' Matt. 24 : 2 5, 26. Therefore‚ I have committed my-
self to Christ alone that whether as a result of the false ex-
communication of men, or, outside that, by natural death or
through violence he may bring my life to a close.

Then in respect to the circumstance of time [as bearing
upon the duty of obedience], it is not doubtful that it is
necessary for the one who gives a command as well as for
the one called upon to obey to know when an act good gener-
ically, or when a neutral act, ought to be performed. For, if
during the paschal festival a prelate bids a subject fast or,
if he has a healthy body, on Good Friday not to fast, would
