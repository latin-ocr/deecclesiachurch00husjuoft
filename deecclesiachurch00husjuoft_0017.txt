IN TROD UCTION xiii

tinctly, is not the bond of Christian unity‚ and nowhere does
he represent the sacraments as the bond of unity‚

F ollowing Augustine, Huss proceeds to show that the
church is a mixed body, made up of predestinate and praesciti,
or reprobate, and he uses the parable of the net and other
parables to prove it. Although according to the popular
opinion—vocationem vulgarem et reputationem ecclesiasticam—
all Christians are members of the church militant, yet it is
one thing, Huss affirmed, to be in the church and another to
be of the church. Judas was in the church for a season, but
ultimately lost, and Paul by predestination was of it even
during the period of his persecuting activity‚ when he was
not in it.l

These definitions set aside the following views which pre-
vailed in Huss's time.

The pope and the cardinals do not constitute the church.
This was a wide-spread popular conception and Huss is at
great pains to prove its fallacy. The document of the eight
doctors had so defined the church. Wyclif, before Huss, had
said that “the public understands by the Roman church the
pope and the cardinals.'' 2

The church is not confined to the body over which the
apostolic see has jurisdiction. The particular Roman church
is a company of the faithful living under the obedience of
Rome, as the companies of the faithful living under the obe-
dience of Antioch and Constantinople were called the church
of Antioch and the church of Constantinople. In a notable
passage in one of his letters to Prachaticz, Huss said suc-
cinctly: “The Roman church is not the catholic apostolic
church, for no partia] church can be the holy catholic church.

¹Pp. 16 sq.‚ 21, 30 sqq„ 41 sqq„ 58, etc. Huss's word praesciti, or foreknown‚
does not contain all that the word reprobate means, although they are one in this
that they both imply ultimate perdition. The first word doas not involve an
active decree of reprobation which the word reprobate is usually taken to
involve.

² Pp. 58, etc., Wyclif’s words are: Communilas intelligit per Rom. eccles.
papam et cardinales quibus est necessarium omnibus aliis obedire. de Ecdes„ 9²·
